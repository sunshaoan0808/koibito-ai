/**
 * VN mode's dialogue box: one floating glass panel of a **fixed height**, carrying either the
 * character's line or — in `inline` input mode — the player's own, in the same frame.
 *
 * The height is fixed on purpose. The box used to grow with its content (`min-h` to `max-h-[40vh]`)
 * and had the composer, choices and a utility row all stacked inside it, so the scene it was
 * covering resized on every turn and the art never got to be the subject. Now the frame is a
 * constant, long replies scroll inside it, and everything that isn't dialogue lives outside it.
 *
 * The read/write swap is deliberately loud where it matters and invisible where it doesn't: the
 * nameplate identity, the accent rail down the left edge, and the caret all change; the frame,
 * its position and its height do not. That's what keeps "the same box is both people" legible
 * rather than confusing — you always know whose box it is, and nothing under it ever moves.
