/**
 * 10b's intent chips — a quiet row inside the composer for tagging *how* the next line is meant.
 * Arming a chip attaches it to the message you send next, then disarms. The tag never moves a stat
 * on its own; it's context for the relationship judge, and can land badly if misread (`intent.ts`).
 *
 * Lives inside the composer card (passed as `Composer`'s `intentSlot`) rather than as its own bar,
 * so it reads as part of composing a message. Reassure and Apologize only appear once there's
 * friction to repair (tension elevated).
