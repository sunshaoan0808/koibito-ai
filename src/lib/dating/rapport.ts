/**
 * 10b's "live feedback during the scene" — a rapport-trajectory read shown while a live date is
 * running. Per-turn relationship *scoring* is deliberately suppressed for the whole date (its
 * outcome is judged once at the end); this is the qualitative counterpart, so the player can feel
 * how a scene is trending without a number moving or the end result being spoiled.
 *
 * `assessRapport` is a cheap, stateless judge call: it reads the last few turns of the date and
 * returns one label, nothing else. It never touches affection or the tracked dimensions.
