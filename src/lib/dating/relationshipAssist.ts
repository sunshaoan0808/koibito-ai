Omit it almost every turn; it shouldn't flip as readily as mood does, and should only be set or changed on a genuinely clear, sustained signal, not one line of dialogue.`,

Omit it on almost every turn; once set it should usually stay omitted (meaning "no change") for a while rather than being reset every exchange.`,
    `"currentDesire" is deeper and steadier than "characterIntent" the same way "currentNeed" is deeper and steadier than "mood" — not a specific plan or agenda item, but a foundational underlying drive that doesn't change turn to turn (e.g. "wants to feel truly seen, not just liked", "wants to matter to someone again", "wants to be the one chosen, not settled for").

"personal" = ${params.charName}'s own life independent of ${params.userName}; "together" = something they want to do with ${params.userName}; "distance" = deliberately holding back or protecting themselves.

Resolve a plan the moment the story has clearly moved past it.`,

Each entry is one of: {"action":"add","text":"the impression in ${params.charName}'s own voice, e.g. 'They're unusually patient with me.'"} to form a new one; {"action":"revise","index":N,"text":"..."} to correct or sharpen belief N once it's proven wrong or too simple; {"action":"drop","index":N} to abandon one that's been clearly disproven. Use [] on almost every turn — only add one when this exchange gives real, repeated-pattern evidence, not from a single isolated moment.`,
    `"expectationUpdates" changes ${params.charName}'s standing expectations of ${params.userName} — something ${params.charName} has started quietly counting on, whether or not ${params.userName} has ever been told. Each entry is one of: {"action":"add","text":"the expectation, e.g. 'expects a check-in most Sundays'"}; {"action":"note","index":N,"note":"..."} to record it playing out; {"action":"resolve","index":N,"outcome":"met"|"violated"} once it's clearly been met or clearly been missed.
