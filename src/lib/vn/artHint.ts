/**
 * "VN mode reads as broken before art exists" — a bare gradient plus a full-bleed avatar looks like
 * a bug, not a "you haven't added art yet" state. This names the *one specific* missing piece so the
 * hint in `VNStage` is actionable: sprites are a character concept and backgrounds a world one, and
 * a user often doesn't realise those are set up separately.
 *
 * Order matters — a character with no sprites gets told that first (it's the bigger gap and the
 * thing most under their control), then the world/background chain. Returns `null` once there's
 * enough art for VN mode to look intentional, or when the user has dismissed the hint for this
 * character.
