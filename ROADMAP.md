# RP Suite Roadmap

Living to-do list for turning this SillyTavern-style local RP client into a modern
visual-novel/anime-inspired RP + dating-sim suite. Checked items are implemented and
verified (`npm run typecheck` + `npm run build` passing). Since [server/db.ts](server/db.ts#L17-L36)
stores everything as JSON blobs, most new fields need no migrations — just extend the TS types.

## 0. Quick wins
- [x] Centralized toast system (`useToastStore.ts` + `ToastViewport.tsx`, mounted once in
      `App.tsx`) replaces the four one-off inline red banners in `GenerateCharacterDialog`,
      `LorebookEditor`, `ChatWindow`/`useChatSession`, and `DateEventPanel` — one `toastError(...)`
      call instead of local error state + dismiss logic in each.
- [x] `visualNovelMode` now renders an actual VN scene (`VNStage.tsx`) instead of doing nothing.
- [x] `NewChatDialog` now previews/picks an opening greeting (with affection-gated greetings filtered
      out) before starting a chat.

## 1. Visual Novel presentation layer
- [x] **Outfits — a second axis on the sprite grid.** `Character.sprites` was a flat
      `expressionId -> url` map, so a story could go anywhere narratively while the sprite stayed
      in the same clothes. This was the one item on the NSFW/VN wishlist that was *structurally*
      blocked rather than merely unpolished (the intimate expressions — `sultry`, `aroused`,
      `yearning` — already existed, as did the intimacy catalog and the explicitness setting; what
      didn't exist was any way for what the player *sees* to change).
      **Explicitly not image compositing.** "Layered sprites" usually means stacking transparent
      body/clothing PNGs at authored offsets — that needs art authored as layers, which is not what
      card packs in this ecosystem ship, and it would make every existing character
      unrepresentable. An outfit here is a complete alternate sprite, the thing VN packs already
      distribute, selected by a second id.
      - **Storage, with zero migration**: composite keys inside the existing `sprites` map. The
        base outfit keeps the bare expression id (`blush`) — byte-for-byte what every character
        already stores, so every existing card is already a valid one-outfit character with no
        backfill. A named outfit prefixes its id (`swimsuit--blush`). `--` is unambiguous by
        construction, not by luck: every id on both sides comes from either `DEFAULT_EXPRESSION_IDS`
        or `slugifyId`, and `slugifyId` collapses runs of non-alphanumerics to a *single* hyphen —
        so no id can contain `--`, and splitting on the first occurrence is exact even when both
        halves contain single hyphens (`school-uniform--half-smile`). Staying inside `sprites` also
        means `resolveAvatarMap`, `pruneUnreferencedFiles` (so deleting an outfit deletes its art),
        backup/restore, and character-delete all work untouched — a nested map would have needed
        all four changed, and a per-outfit subdirectory would have put an author-supplied id into a
        filesystem path, the exact shape `SAFE_KEY_RE` exists to prevent.
      - **Resolution degrades outfit -> base -> avatar** (`resolveExpressionSprite`, now
        outfit-aware): exact expression in the outfit, then the outfit's own `EXPRESSION_FALLBACKS`
        chain, then the outfit's neutral, then the whole same walk in base art. An author who drew
        only two swimsuit expressions still gets a real character for the other nineteen — wrong
        clothes for one beat beats no character at all. Omitting the argument reproduces the
        pre-outfit behavior exactly, which is covered by its own regression test.
      - **Selection follows the app's "model proposes, app disposes" rule.** The scene tag gained
        `outfit=ID`, offered only when there's more than one selectable outfit — a character with
        only base art gets the exact instruction it always got, with no extra prompt tokens.
        `selectableOutfitIds` withholds anything locked (affection), flag-gated, `manualOnly`, or
        artless, and `sanitizeSceneTag` re-applies that same gate to what comes back. An invalid
        outfit tag is *dropped* rather than coerced to base, because outfits are sticky: an absent
        tag means "unchanged", so a bad tag leaves the character dressed as they were instead of
        yanking them back to base mid-scene. `currentOutfitFrom` scans back for the last explicit
        tag, so a model that simply stops repeating the field can never undress anyone.
      - **`manualOnly`** exists specifically so an undressed state can be real art sitting on disk
        that the model is never offered — entered deliberately, not because a reply read as
        suggestive.
      - Editor: the sprite grid now edits one outfit at a time behind a chip row (with per-outfit
        coverage counts), rather than becoming 21xN cells long. Per-outfit warmth gate, required
        scene flags, rename, "never chosen by the model", and delete. Deleting a custom expression
        now clears it from *every* outfit, not just the visible one — otherwise its art elsewhere
        would be orphaned with no cell left to reach it from. `.rppack` export/import carries
        `outfits`, without which the composite keys would survive an export with no outfit to
        belong to.
      - Server: `normalizeOutfits` validates ids against the same character class used for sprite
        keys (an outfit id becomes half a filename), rejects the reserved `base`, rejects ids
        containing the separator, and dedupes. `SAFE_KEY_RE`'s length cap went 40 -> 90 to fit a
        composite key; the character class — which is what actually prevents traversal, admitting
        no `/`, `\`, or `.` — is unchanged.
      **Live-verified end to end against the real database, including hostile input**: a
      round-tripped character kept its valid outfits and composite sprite keys, wrote each to its
      own correctly-scoped file, and dropped every attack in the same payload — a `../../` sprite
      key, a `../../etc/passwd` outfit id, an outfit claiming the reserved `base`, one containing
      `--`, and a duplicate id. Resolution was then re-checked against that persisted record: the
      per-key unlock gate held at 59 vs 60 warmth, a missing outfit expression fell to the outfit's
      own neutral, base resolution was unchanged, and the selectable set correctly went
      `[base]` -> `[base]` -> `[base, swimsuit]` across the affection and scene-flag gates while
      never offering the `manualOnly` outfit. Test character and its files deleted afterwards; the
      existing character was left untouched (21 sprites, no outfits, no composite keys).
- [x] VN dialogue mode: full-bleed scene with background, sprite, and bottom dialogue box
      (`VNStage.tsx`), with a backlog toggle.
- [x] Character sprites & expressions: `Character.sprites`/`spriteUnlocks` per expression id,
      uploaded per-character in `CharacterEditor`.
- [x] **Broadened the default expression set with love/arousal range** — user-requested: the
      original 16 covered general emotional range (happy/sad/angry/etc.) plus a couple of mild
      romantic ones (blush, love), but nothing for the more intense end a dating-sim scene actually
      needs. Added five (`DEFAULT_EXPRESSIONS`, `expressions.ts`): flirty, smitten, yearning,
      sultry, aroused — 21 built-in expressions total. Purely additive (just more entries in the
      same array everything else already reads generically), so no other code needed to change;
      each is still just a category a creator uploads their own art for.
- [x] Expression selection: the model tags each reply with an inline scene directive
      (`src/lib/vn/sceneTag.ts`), sanitized against unlocked expression/background ids in
      `useChatSession.ts`.
- [x] Scene backgrounds: `World.backgrounds`/`backgroundUnlocks`, selectable by the model via the
      same scene tag, gated by affection.
- [x] **Bugfix: a brand-new chat's VN screen had no expression/background at all** (#114) —
      user-reported: opened a fresh chat in VN mode and got a bare placeholder gradient even though
      the world had real art uploaded for every location. Root cause: the scene tag above is
      something the *model* appends to a *generated* reply — a chat's very first message is the
      character's static `first_mes`, which nobody generates, so it never gets one. Fixed with
      `detectGreetingScene` (`src/lib/vn/sceneVision.ts`): a one-shot, best-effort, text-only
      classification pass (temperature 0.1, ~40 tokens) run once at chat creation
      (`createChat.ts`), reading only the rendered greeting text against the same unlocked
      expression/background ids the live scene tag would offer — factored out as
      `getUnlockedExpressionIds`/`getUnlockedBackgroundIds` (`src/lib/vn/unlocks.ts`) so the two
      paths can never offer different ids for the same character/affection. Gated on there being
      actual custom art to choose from (a character with sprites, or a world with real background
      images) so a plain install never pays for a wasted model call. 13 new tests (442 total: 6 for
      `detectGreetingScene`, 7 for the newly-extracted `unlocks.ts`).
      Verified live on Gemma end-to-end: a fresh chat came back
      `{"expression":"embarrassed","background":"classroom"}` for a library-set greeting after the
      prompt was tuned to prefer the closest approximate match over declining — the first pass only
      picked an expression and left background empty, which held up as the model correctly playing
      it safe rather than a bug, but a nudge toward "closest is better than none" got it picking
      confidently on the very next fresh chat. VN mode's first screen now shows real art immediately
      instead of only after the first real reply lands.
- [x] Sprite transitions: `vn-sprite` idle animation in `globals.css`, respects `reducedMotion`.
- [x] Name-plate + dialogue box styled to match VN layout with character accent color.
- [x] Sprite crossfade: `VNStage.tsx` now dips to transparent and back instead of hard-swapping
      when the active expression changes (`useSpriteCrossfade`), respecting `reducedMotion` for
      free via the global transition-duration override in `globals.css`. Outfit/pose *layers* — a
      real layered sprite composition system, not just a transition — is a separate, much bigger
      effort and remains open. Section 11's "generate a full expression set" bullet (#125) is
      shipped now, so the prerequisite this was waiting on — art generated on demand instead of
      hand-uploaded per expression — genuinely exists; the layering system itself still doesn't.
- [x] **Fixed: sprite silently cropped to a sliver on a wide-but-short window** — user-reported,
      reproduced directly (a real character's portrait sprite showed only the top of the head on a
      1440×700 viewport). A classic flexbox bug: the sprite's flex container defaulted to
      `min-height: auto`, so it refused to shrink below the sprite's natural (unconstrained) height
      on a short viewport — the oversized box then got silently clipped by the stage's own
      `overflow-hidden`, instead of `max-h-[85%]` ever getting a definite height to resolve
      against and actually scale the image down. Fixed with `min-h-0` on the container, the
      standard fix for this flex-shrink class of bug. Verified live: reproduced the crop at
      1440×700 before the fix, confirmed it renders correctly there after, and confirmed normal
      desktop sizes were unaffected either way.
- [x] **Custom scene locations, and a real gallery-CG data-loss bug fixed** (#127) — the user's own
      direct follow-up ask: "make it possible in the World to create more Scene backgrounds, easier
      to add CG gallery." World backgrounds were a fixed 12-location list (`DEFAULT_BACKGROUNDS`)
      with no way to add one, unlike character expressions, which already let an author extend the
      default set. **`CustomBackground`** ([src/lib/vn/backgrounds.ts](src/lib/vn/backgrounds.ts))
      closes that gap — same shape and same "author extends a fixed default set" pattern as
      `CustomExpression`, plumbed through `WorldCard.customBackgrounds`, server-side normalization
      (`server/app.ts`), and the character/world pack export/import format
      (`src/lib/characters/pack.ts`), not just the editor form. `slugifyBackgroundId` shares its
      actual slug logic with `CustomExpression`'s own `slugifyExpressionId` via a newly-extracted
      `slugifyId()` ([src/lib/text/slugify.ts](src/lib/text/slugify.ts)) rather than a copy-pasted
      near-duplicate — both existing tests kept passing unchanged, confirming the extraction is a
      pure refactor, not a behavior change.
      **A real, unrelated bug found and fixed while making the CG gallery genuinely easier to use**:
      `normalizeGalleryEntries` (`server/app.ts`) silently deleted a CG gallery entry's title/unlock
      hint/threshold/required-flags on save if it had no `imageUrl` yet — dead code from before this
      app could ever create a CG in stages, but a real, easy-to-hit trap now that generating one's
      art (#125's `GenerateImageButton`) is an async operation a creator could easily save mid-flight
      of, or deliberately skip until later. `GalleryView.tsx` already rendered a missing `imageUrl`
      safely (a placeholder, not a crash), so nothing was actually protected by dropping the entry
      server-side too — just removed the filter. Verified live end-to-end for both fixes: added a
      custom background, saved, confirmed via a direct `GET /api/worlds` that `customBackgrounds`
      persisted correctly, removed it, saved again, confirmed it's gone; added a titled CG with no
      image, saved, confirmed via `GET /api/characters` that the *entire entry* used to vanish and
      now survives intact, removed it, saved again, confirmed the gallery is back to empty.

## 2. Dating-sim mechanics
- [x] **World rules: an author-facing "when X, then Y" layer.** The app already *produced* every
      signal an author would want to react to — the seven relationship dimensions, scene flags, the
      commitment ladder, the world clock — and there was no way to hang behaviour off any of them
      without editing code. A world author could write lore, gifts and thresholds, but not "once
      she trusts him enough, she'll have told him about her father."
      - **Deliberately not a scripting language.** RisuAI's CBS and AI Dungeon's scenario scripts
        both go that way and both pay for it in sandboxing, debuggability, and a syntax nobody can
        read six months later. This is a closed set of conditions over state the app already
        computes, and a closed set of actions that route into systems that already exist — a rule
        cannot do anything the app could not already do, it only decides *when*.
      - **Conditions**: a stat at least / below a threshold (any dimension, plus `affection` and
        derived `warmth`), a scene flag being set, the commitment ladder at or above a rung, and
        the world clock past a given day. All must hold; an empty condition list never fires rather
        than firing constantly.
      - **Actions**: `remember` (writes a durable `ChatFact`, which then rides into every later
        prompt through the existing "Remembered facts" lorebook — the one action that changes what
        the model knows), `set_flag` (so gallery entries, outfits and other rules can all gate on
        an authored beat), and `notify`.
      - **One-shot by default**, remembered per *chat* rather than per world (`Chat.firedTriggerIds`)
        so two chats in the same world progress through it independently and a fork inherits
        exactly what its parent had fired. A one-shot cannot re-fire when a stat dips below its
        threshold and comes back. `repeatable` is opt-in, because a repeatable rule that sets a
        flag or writes a memory would otherwise do it on every single turn.
      - Evaluated after the per-turn relationship update, against the state that turn just
        *produced* rather than the state it started from — a rule keyed on "trust >= 70" fires on
        the turn trust actually reaches 70, not one turn later. Primary character only: a world
        rule describes the player's relationship with the character whose world it is, and firing
        one per participant would multiply every authored beat. Nothing here calls a model, and
        nothing here can fail a turn.
      - Unknown condition/action kinds (data from a newer build, or hand-edited) never hold and are
        dropped on save — silently firing an author's rule on a condition this build cannot
        evaluate would be worse than not firing it.
      **Live-verified against the real database, including hostile input**: a save carrying one
      valid rule plus eight malformed ones kept exactly the valid rule and dropped every other —
      empty conditions, empty actions, an unknown stat, an unknown condition kind, an unknown
      action kind, a duplicate id, and a blank id — while correctly *clamping* rather than
      rejecting an out-of-range threshold (999 -> 100). The editor then rendered both survivors
      with their per-kind forms and plain-English summary lines ("When trust >= 70 and flag
      \"confession\" -> remember ..., set flag \"promise\"").
- [x] **Aftercare now echoes past its own window.** A `cold` verdict leaves `currentNeed:
      'reassurance'` behind, so a bad aftermath keeps colouring the character afterwards through
      machinery that already exists (`prompt/mindGuidance.ts` already injects the need every turn
      and already decays it only when the judge reads a genuine change) rather than through a
      second bespoke timer. The judge's own read for the turn still wins when it has one — it is
      the fresher signal. Only `cold` leaves a need: "they were looked after" is not an unmet need,
      and inventing a positive one would put words in the judge's mouth about a character who has
      nothing to want.
- [x] **Regression guard for the whole `getRelationshipTrack` bug class.** That function builds the
      primary's track by hand-listing fields rather than spreading, so a field added to
      `RelationshipTrack` can be persisted correctly and still be invisible to every reader — which
      is exactly what happened to `afterglow`, leaving a whole feature inert with every test green.
      The fixture is now typed `Required<RelationshipTrack>`, so adding a field to that type breaks
      *compilation* of the test until the fixture covers it, and then breaks the assertion until
      `getRelationshipTrack` actually returns it. Verified by reintroducing the original bug and
      watching the test fail naming the missing field, then restoring the fix.
- [x] **Aftercare: the hours after an intimate scene now count.** Intimacy was the one beat the
      simulation dropped the moment it ended — the scene got written, a couple of stats moved on
      the turn itself, and the next morning read like any other turn. The hours *after* are where a
      relationship actually gets made or quietly damaged, and they are the part a dating sim can
      model without writing a word of the content itself.
      - **The window** (`src/lib/dating/aftercare.ts`) opens on the two signals the app already
        *knows* rather than has to infer: an explicit intimacy action from the Relationship panel
        (the same signal that drives the outfit switch), and an accepted "first time together". A
        deflected or backfired ask opens nothing — there is no aftermath to judge, and scoring one
        would punish the player twice for the same no.
      - **Counted in the character's own replies**, not raw messages (which grow at a different
        rate depending on how much the player types) and not world-clock time (which one action can
        advance by a whole day, closing the window instantly). A window whose start ends up *ahead*
        of the conversation — exactly what a rewind or a fork-from-earlier produces — reads as no
        window at all rather than as "0 turns in", so an aftermath can't be reopened for a scene
        that no longer exists in this timeline.
      - **During it**, `afterglowGuidance` writes the character as someone in the aftermath, in two
        registers: the immediate beat, and the hours afterwards carrying on with something changed
        in them. Deliberately the one piece of character state the app sets itself rather than
        reading back from the judge — the player initiated the scene through a real action, so
        there is nothing to guess at. It names no physical detail at all: this steers *emotional*
        aftermath, and the content rating stays the only thing governing explicitness (a test
        asserts that).
      - **At the end**, one verdict — `tender` / `awkward` / `cold` — judged over the whole window
        and applied deterministically. It costs **no extra model call**: the ask rides along inside
        the per-turn judge that was already going to run, exactly the way objective-task detection
        already does. Deltas are sized between the two existing scales on purpose: louder than a
        single ordinary turn (±2) because it is a verdict on several, quieter than a whole date
        (±5) because it is a coda. `cold` is the sharpest and the only one that adds tension;
        `awkward` is near-neutral, because fumbling the moment is not a betrayal and most real
        aftermaths land there. A due window always closes even when the model returns nothing
        usable (read as `awkward`), so the aftermath guidance can never run forever.
      - Logged to the relationship history with its own reason line, so a later "why did trust drop
        4" has an answer, and surfaced in the Relationship panel while open — phrased to say what is
        true without saying what to do, since the whole point is that it scores what the player
        chooses.
      **A real bug the live check caught, which unit tests could not have**: `getRelationshipTrack`
      enumerates the primary character's fields explicitly rather than spreading them, so
      `afterglow` was persisted correctly and then invisible to *every* reader — the panel and,
      more importantly, the prompt guidance itself. The whole feature would have shipped inert for
      the primary character (i.e. for almost every chat) while every test still passed. Fixed by
      adding it to both `TrackHost` and the primary branch, then re-verified in the browser: the
      panel correctly showed "2 more replies" for a window opened 2 replies earlier in a real
      79-reply chat, and the boundary was checked against that same chat at 0/2/3 turns in (active),
      4 and 8 turns in (complete), and a start ahead of the conversation (inert).
- [x] **Per-world content rating, and one dial that finally governs both surfaces.**
      `intimacyLevel` was a single global switch, which stops working the moment someone runs more
      than one world — a wholesome slice-of-life world and an explicit one cannot share one dial,
      and flipping it in Settings between chats is both tedious and easy to forget in the direction
      that matters. `WorldCard.intimacyLevel` now overrides it per world (Worlds -> Dating sim ->
      Content rating); a world is the right scope, since gifts, the intimacy catalog, scene flags,
      and relationship thresholds are all already authored there.
      - **An override, not a ceiling.** Clamping to the stricter of the two reads safer but breaks
        the actual case: the global default is `'default'`, which is what anyone who never opened
        the setting has, so under clamping an explicit world could never be explicit. Confirmed
        live — this machine's global setting *is* `'default'`. The world is the more specific,
        more deliberate statement, so it wins in both directions.
      - **`undefined` (inherit) is distinct from an explicit `'default'`**, which pins a world to
        sending no instruction even if the global later changes.
      - **The Relationship panel now respects the rating too.** It previously rendered all four
        intimacy categories as clickable regardless, so a chat set to fade-to-black still handed
        the player buttons that send an explicit action line as their own message — the dial held
        on the prompt and not on the UI. `allowedIntimacyCategories` is the shared rule.
      - **One deliberate asymmetry, corrected mid-implementation.** The first cut had the panel
        match the prompt exactly, which withholds explicit categories at every level except
        `'explicit'`. That was wrong: `intimacyGuidance`'s own contract is that `'default'` is
        "the exact behavior every chat already had before this setting existed, so nobody's
        existing output changes unless they deliberately pick a level" — and hiding the buttons at
        `'default'` would have silently removed actions from every user who never opened the
        setting. Only a rating that actually asks for *less* (`fade_to_black`/`suggestive`) now
        takes the choice away. The two rules answer different questions — what the model may
        volunteer unprompted, versus what the player may explicitly ask for — and a test asserts
        that difference on purpose rather than letting a later change quietly re-align them.
      - **Bug found and fixed while verifying**: "Use the global setting" sent
        `intimacyLevel: undefined`, which `JSON.stringify` drops entirely, so the field never
        reached the server, the `'intimacyLevel' in req.body` guard was false, and clearing a
        rating silently left the old one in place. Reproduced live (explicit -> "use global" ->
        still explicit) before fixing it to send `null`, the same convention `Chat.activeEvent`
        and `Chat.authorNote` already use for exactly this trap.
      - Also fixed in passing: `intimacyLevel` was never in `buildCurrentPrompt`'s dependency
        array, so changing it left the callback closed over the old value until some other
        dependency moved; and `customIntimacyOptions` was missing from the world **create**
        handler's field list, so a world created with authored intimacy options in one request
        lost them (masked because the update handler's spread restored them on the next save).
- [x] **An explicit intimacy action now changes what the character is wearing.** Using a
      position/toy/activity from the Relationship panel (never a kissing spot) switches the
      character into their designated intimate outfit — `Outfit.intimate`, marked in the character
      editor. Decided by the app rather than left to the model: this is a discrete, unambiguous,
      player-initiated act, and the outfit it implies is usually `manualOnly` precisely so the
      model cannot put anyone there on its own. Stamped onto the player's own message so it takes
      effect from that moment rather than only once the reply agrees — which is why
      `currentOutfitFrom` deliberately does not filter to character messages. One-way by design:
      entering is a discrete signal, leaving is a narrative judgement with no comparable one, so
      the story tags its own way back out via an ordinary `outfit=` on a later reply.
- [x] Affection/relationship meter: `Chat.affection`/`relationshipStage`, updated by an AI-graded
      pass after each reply (`assessAffectionDelta` in `relationshipAssist.ts`), mirroring
      `detectCompletedTasks`.
- [x] Relationship stages/unlocks: affection gates lorebook entries (`affectionMin`), sprites,
      and backgrounds.
- [x] Date/event scenarios: `DateEventCard` + `DateEventPanel`, plugs into the existing
      `Objective` system (`startDateEvent`/`suggestDateEventIdea`).
- [x] Gifting/choices: structured `ChoiceOption` (`kind: 'line' | 'action' | 'gift'`) rendered via
      `ChoiceList`, generated by `generateChoices` (`src/lib/prompt/choices.ts`).
- [x] CG/gallery unlocks: `Character.gallery` (`GalleryEntry[]`), unlocked by affection and/or
      scene flags, viewable in the `Gallery` tab (`GalleryView.tsx`).
- [x] Gift inventory/economy: dedicated gift catalog (`src/lib/dating/gifts.ts`) with
      rarity/price, per-chat `giftCoins`/`giftInventory`/`giftsGiven`, a buyable shop in
      `RelationshipPanel`, and per-character `giftPreferences` so gift choices have lasting,
      deterministic affection effects (not just flavor text).
- [x] Branching scene memory flags: `SceneFlag` (`first_date`, `confession`, `jealousy`,
      `promise`) detected conservatively after each reply (`detectSceneFlags`), persisted on
      `Chat.sceneFlags`, and usable as `GalleryEntry.requiredFlags` for deterministic (not purely
      AI-judged) unlock gating.
- [x] Relationship panel transparency: `RelationshipPanel.tsx` shows current stage/affection,
      next milestone threshold, scene-flag checklist, next sprite/background/gallery unlock
      requirements, and the gift shop/inventory — opened from the ♡ button in `ChatWindow` header.
- [x] **Hardcoded/duplicated relationship constants** — `RELATIONSHIP_MILESTONES`/`SCENE_FLAGS`
      now live once in [stage.ts](src/lib/dating/stage.ts) and are imported by
      `RelationshipPanel.tsx` and `relationshipAssist.ts` instead of being re-hardcoded.
      Thresholds are now authorable per world too: `WorldCard.relationshipThresholds` (optional
      per-stage overrides, editable in `WorldsView`) feeds `relationshipMilestonesFor()`, used
      everywhere a stage is computed (`useChatSession`, `NewChatDialog`, `RelationshipPanel`).
      Scene-flag authoring (custom flags beyond the fixed 4) — done; see the item-53-adjacent
      changelog entry in section 9 for the full writeup.
- [x] **Gift catalog is a single fixed global array** — `WorldCard.gifts?: GiftItem[]` overrides
      the built-in `DEFAULT_GIFT_CATALOG` (`gifts.ts`) for any character living in that world, with
      basic CRUD (add/edit/remove name, rarity, price) in the `WorldsView` editor. `getGiftCatalog(world)`
      is the one place that resolves "this world's gifts, or the default" — used by
      `RelationshipPanel`, `CharacterEditor`'s gift-preferences section, and `useChatSession`
      (buying, gifting via choices, starter inventory). Server-side `normalizeGiftItems()`
      validates shape on save, mirroring `normalizeGalleryEntries`.
- [x] **Multi-dimensional relationship stats** (the core of 10c's "Multi-dimensional bonds") —
      `Chat.relationshipStats: { trust, chemistry, comfort, respect, curiosity, tension }`
      (`types.ts`) tracks six dimensions alongside the existing `affection`. `computeWarmth()`
      (`stage.ts`) derives an overall closeness score from affection + trust + chemistry + comfort
      + respect (curiosity and tension deliberately excluded — interest and friction aren't
      "warmth"), and `RelationshipStage` is now a 6-stage ladder — `near_strangers` →
      `acquaintances` → `warming_up` → `getting_close` → `close` → `sweethearts` — replacing the
      old 4-stage `strangers`/`curious`/`close`/`romance` union everywhere a stage is computed or
      displayed (`ChatWindow`, `VNStage`, `RelationshipPanel`, `NewChatDialog`). The single judge
      pass in `relationshipAssist.ts` (`assessAffectionDelta` → `assessRelationshipDeltas`) now
      scores all seven dimensions per turn instead of one, still following the same
      "AI produces a small validated delta, code applies it" pattern. `affection` itself keeps its
      field name and remains what lorebook/sprite/background/gallery unlock thresholds gate on —
      deliberately not renamed, to avoid a breaking change to every existing unlock threshold.
      **Deliberately out of scope for this pass** (still open, per 10c/section 2's original note):
      the Define-the-Relationship ladder, breakups/reconciliation, the endings gallery, rival/
      multiple romanceable characters sharing a world (blocked on group chats, section 4), and any
      save-slot/route concept (section 12).
- [x] **Relationship state now actually reaches the model, not just unlock gates** — until this
      pass, `affection`/`relationshipStats` only ever gated WHICH content was available (lorebook
      entries, sprites, backgrounds, gallery); nothing told the model itself how the relationship
      is going, so in-character warmth couldn't track the numbers unless an author happened to
      write affection-gated lore for every stage. `buildRelationshipDescription()`
      (`useChatSession.ts`) now builds one short, qualitative line — stage label plus at most a
      couple of notable-dimension notes ("a deep mutual trust has built up"), deliberately never a
      raw number — injected in the same late "right before generation" slot the objective block
      already uses (`PromptBuildInput.relationshipDescription`, `builder.ts`). Verified live via
      the Prompt Inspector, which shows it automatically since it's plain text in the same
      assembled prompt, no separate wiring needed. Gated behind the new `autoTrackRelationship`
      setting (off = no block, matching "nothing is being tracked for this chat").
- [x] **Two sequential judge calls merged into one** — `assessRelationshipDeltas` and
      `detectSceneFlags` used to be separate, always-fire-every-turn `client.generate()` round
      trips; combined into one `assessRelationshipMoment()` call (`relationshipAssist.ts`) that
      returns both deltas and new flags from a single prompt. On a local single-GPU KoboldCpp
      server every background classifier call after a reply is serialized — with the (also
      always-fire) memory-summary and task-detection calls plus the conditional gallery-unlock and
      choice-suggestion calls, this was becoming a real per-turn latency cost, not just an
      inefficiency. `detectGalleryUnlocks` stays separate since it's a genuine second step (only
      runs when locked entries exist AND depends on this call's own flag results).
- [x] **`autoTrackRelationship` setting** — relationship tracking used to always run
      unconditionally, the only AI-assist feature (unlike summarize/objectives/choices) with no
      toggle. Added alongside the others in Settings → Generation, default on; also gates the new
      prompt-steering line above.
- [x] **Milestone/unlock toasts** — stage-ups and gallery-CG unlocks used to be completely silent;
      the only way to notice one was to happen to open the Relationship panel or Gallery tab. Now
      surfaced via the existing `toastSuccess()` system the moment they happen. Deliberately NOT
      toasting scene flags or per-turn stat deltas — those are internal bookkeeping/would be
      constant noise, not a player-facing reward.
- [x] **Intimacy detail setting** (#127) — the user's own direct request: "add more romance,
      romantic scenes and more (NSFW)." This app writes no narrative content itself — the connected
      model does — so the real feature is a genuine, user-controlled dial over how explicit that
      model gets once a scene the story has actually built toward turns intimate, the same
      "deterministic code sets the knob, the model writes the words" split as every other
      prompt-steering setting here. Deliberately separate from the existing `slowBurnPacing`, which
      governs *pacing* (how fast affection is earned), not *register* (how the prose reads once it
      has been). `intimacyGuidance()`
      ([src/lib/prompt/intimacyGuidance.ts](src/lib/prompt/intimacyGuidance.ts)) maps a new
      `IntimacyDetailLevel` (`'default' | 'fade_to_black' | 'suggestive' | 'explicit'`) to a prompt
      instruction, picked via a Settings → Generation button row right under Slow-burn pacing.
      `'default'` sends no instruction at all — identical behavior to every chat before this setting
      existed, so nobody's existing output changes unless they deliberately pick a level, in either
      direction: towards less explicit (`fade_to_black`) or more (`explicit`, framed in its own
      instruction text as the user's own deliberate, enabled choice). 4 new tests
      (`intimacyGuidance.test.ts`) confirm the default is truly empty, the three opt-in levels are
      each non-empty and distinct from each other, and the specific framing each is supposed to
      carry (fade-to-black explicitly tells the model not to narrate explicit content; explicit
      names itself as user-enabled) actually landed in the text. 572 tests total, typecheck and
      build clean. Live-verified: the four-way picker renders and persists the choice correctly,
      reset back to 'default' afterward — actually generating a scene at each level needs a real
      connected model, not exercised this session.

## 3. Character & content creation
- [x] Multi-sprite upload UI in `CharacterEditor` with an unlock-affection field per expression.
- [x] **Bulk sprite upload by filename** — user-requested: pre-made expression art is often already
      named after the expression it depicts (`laughing.png`, `annoyed.png`), so uploading one at a
      time per slot was pure friction for a full set. A new "+ Bulk upload by filename" control
      accepts a multi-file picker selection, matches each file's basename (extension stripped,
      case-insensitive) against every known expression id — built-in and this character's own
      custom ones — and assigns matches in one pass, toasting which filenames matched and which
      didn't (so a typo'd filename doesn't just silently fail to land anywhere). Surfaced a real,
      pre-existing bug along the way: saving many sprite images in one request could exceed
      Express's 25MB body-size limit (`PayloadTooLargeError`) — raised to 150MB, generous since this
      is a local-only single-user app, not a public API needing a tight ceiling. Verified live
      end-to-end with a real 21-image expression set: every file matched its correct slot and the
      save succeeded after the limit fix.
- [x] **Fixed: clicking an expression's box didn't open the file picker** — user-reported, found
      while building the custom-expressions bullet below. Each expression slot's `<label>` wrapped
      *two* labelable controls (the unlock-affection number input and the hidden file input) with
      no `htmlFor`; a label with no explicit target implicitly activates whichever labelable
      descendant comes first in the DOM, and the number input came first — so clicking the sprite
      box/emoji just focused the number input instead of opening a file dialog. Fixed by reordering
      the file input first. Verified live: simulated a click on the visible box and confirmed the
      hidden file input now receives it (previously it didn't), while a direct click on the number
      input still behaves normally and never opens the file picker.
- [x] **Custom expressions beyond the fixed default set** — user-reported gap: the Expressions grid
      only ever rendered upload slots for `DEFAULT_EXPRESSIONS`' fixed 16 (`src/lib/vn/
      expressions.ts`), with no way to add one of your own (a signature smirk unique to one
      character, say). Turned out the rest of the pipeline was already fully generic and needed no
      changes at all: `getUnlockedExpressionIds()` already reads whatever keys are actually present
      in `character.sprites` rather than the fixed list, `extractSceneTag`/`sanitizeSceneTag` never
      validated against a closed set, and VNStage's sprite lookup is a plain `sprites?.[expression]`
      — the *only* gap was the editor UI never offering a slot for anything else. Added
      `Character.customExpressions?: { id, label }[]` (`cardSpec.ts`) — just the id/label
      definitions; the actual sprite images still live in the same `sprites`/`spriteUnlocks` maps
      as any default expression, so every other consumer needed zero changes. `slugifyExpressionId()`
      (`expressions.ts`, 7 tests) turns a free-typed label into a safe id (matches the server's
      `SAFE_KEY_RE`, since it becomes both a sprite filename and a literal token in the model's
      prompt), suffixing on collision with a default or existing custom id. Wired into character
      packs (`pack.ts`) so it round-trips on export/import alongside the sprites themselves.
      Verified live end-to-end: added a custom expression through the real editor UI, uploaded a
      real sprite for it via the API (exercising the exact same server code the UI's file picker
      calls), and confirmed the Prompt Inspector listed it as a valid expression ID for the model to
      tag replies with.
- [x] AI-assisted sprite/portrait/CG generation — shipped as section 11's #124/#125: four
      `ImageBackend` implementations (A1111, ComfyUI, SwarmUI, NovelAI) and `GenerateImageButton`
      wired into every art slot (avatar, sprites, backgrounds, gallery CGs), plus a dedicated
      expression-set generator. See section 11's own changelog for the full write-up.
- [x] Voice presets per character — `Character.voice?: { provider?, voiceId? }` (`cardSpec.ts`)
      overrides the global `ttsProvider`/`ttsVoice` in `CompanionView.tsx`, editable in a "Voice"
      section in `CharacterEditor`; unset fields fall back to the global Settings → Voice config.
- [x] Character "relationship starter" field — `Character.relationshipStarters[]` (label + blurb +
      starting affection), editable in `CharacterEditor`. `NewChatDialog` offers a picker; choosing
      one seeds `Chat.affection`/`relationshipStage` and drops the blurb into `Chat.summary`, which
      the prompt builder already surfaces as "Story so far: …" — so the model has the backstory
      from message one instead of every chat starting blank.
- [x] **World Info / lorebook depth** — brought `activateWorldInfo` (`src/lib/worldinfo/
      activation.ts`) up to SillyTavern's actual feature set instead of just the always/keyword/
      manual basics it already had:
      - **Probability** — `LorebookEntry.probability?: number` (0-100), a "Chance %" field in
        `LorebookEditor` shown only for keyword-mode entries (always/manual ignore it, since
        "sometimes fires" would contradict what those modes mean). A keyword match still has to
        pass a roll to actually activate.
      - **Inclusion groups** — `LorebookEntry.group?: string`; entries sharing a non-empty group
        are mutually exclusive, only the highest-`insertion_order` one fires. Useful for
        alternative phrasings of the same beat (e.g. three "how the tavern reacts" entries that
        shouldn't all fire together). Losers go into a new `droppedForGroup` result bucket
        (kept separate from `droppedForBudget` so the Prompt Inspector's wording stays accurate —
        one says "didn't fit the token budget", the other "lost to a higher-priority entry").
      - **Regex keys** — a key formatted as `/pattern/flags` (ST's own convention) now matches via
        `RegExp` instead of literal substring; an invalid pattern falls back to literal matching
        rather than throwing. Documented inline via the Keys field's label instead of a separate
        UI control.
      - **Recursive scanning** — actually consumes `Lorebook.recursive_scanning`, which existed on
        the type from card imports but was dead: never read anywhere. A depth-capped (3 passes)
        second wave scans just-activated keyword entries' own `content` for further keyword
        matches, so e.g. an entry mentioning "Ashfall Keep" can pull in the Ashfall Keep entry even
        though the player never typed it. Always/manual entries don't participate in the recursive
        wave (they're already fully resolved before it runs) and can't be recursively triggered
        either. A toggle lives at the book level in `LorebookEditor`.
      Deliberately left out at the time (needed new persisted per-chat-per-entry state, a bigger
      change): sticky (an entry stays active for N more turns after it stops matching) and cooldown
      (an entry can't refire for N turns after it does). ~~Both shipped later, in #94~~ — via a new
      `Lorebook.sourceKey` (the composite-key prerequisite the roadmap kept flagging) and
      `Chat.worldInfoState`. ~~`delay` followed in #95~~ (`LorebookEntry.delay`, gated on the same
      threaded turn counter, applies to every activation mode) — the activation engine now matches
      SillyTavern's own in full. 14 new vitest cases in
      `activation.test.ts` (probability boundaries, regex matching incl. invalid-pattern fallback,
      group exclusivity, recursive scanning incl. a cycle/no-infinite-loop case) — 33/33 passing.
      Verified live: new "Chance %"/"Group"/"Recursive scanning" controls render and behave
      correctly in the browser (Chance % hides itself outside keyword mode), typecheck clean,
      full suite (81 tests) green.

## 4. Chat & roleplay mechanics
- [x] Branching/checkpoints: `Chat.parentChatId`/`forkedFromMessageId` plus `POST
      /api/chats/:id/fork` (`server/app.ts`) clone the chat's relationship/gift/gallery state,
      the active objective, and the transcript up to a given message into a brand-new chat — the
      original is untouched. A "⑂" action on any message (`MessageBubble`, VN quick-actions)
      forks from there and switches to the new chat; the chat list badges forks, and the header
      shows a "⑂ original chat" jump-back link.
- [x] **Group chats: multiple characters in one chat** — shipped as a minimal, deliberately
      scoped-down slice rather than the full `Scene` concept this bullet originally floated (no
      location/objective/atmosphere entity, no AI-directed turn policy — see the cuts below).
      `Chat.characterId` stays the "primary" (relationship stats/gifts/gallery/VN sprites all stay
      keyed on it, unchanged); a new `Chat.participants?: string[]` holds extra characters who can
      also speak, unset for every chat that existed before this — no migration needed.
      - **Who's "active" for a given turn** is resolved once (`resolveSpeaker()` in
        `useChatSession.ts`) and reused by both prompt-building and generation, so they can never
        disagree about who's speaking: the picked character's own card becomes the full
        system_prompt/description/personality/scenario identity block (exactly like an ordinary
        chat), and everyone else present becomes a compact roster line
        (`PromptBuildInput.participants`, `builder.ts`) — "Also present in this scene: - Aria: …".
      - **The actual bug this fixed**: `renderTurn` (`builder.ts`) used to stamp *every* historical
        char turn with the primary's name regardless of who "said" it — `StoredMessage.name` was
        already per-message-correct but silently ignored at prompt-build time. It now uses each
        turn's own `msg.name`, which is a no-op for every existing single-character chat (name was
        always the primary's anyway) and the actual fix for a participant's lines reading correctly
        in history.
      - **Turn-taking is manual, not AI-directed**: a "reply as ▾" picker in `Composer.tsx` (only
        rendered once `chat.participants` is non-empty) sets which character's reply gets generated
        next; `StoredMessage.speakerId` records it (`undefined` = primary, so again no migration).
        Regenerating/swiping/continuing a message keeps whoever originally said it rather than
        letting that silently change the speaker.
      - ~~**Relationship tracking**~~, gift-aware/objective-driven choice suggestions, and the
        in-character relationship nudge all stayed primary-only at first — gated on `speaker.id ===
        character.id` in both `useChatSession.ts` and `buildCurrentPrompt`. Caught one real bug
        here live: the relationship nudge originally read `{{char}}` — which resolves to
        whoever's *speaking* — so asking Kestrel to reply momentarily attributed the player's
        relationship *with Aria* to Kestrel. Fixed by spelling out the primary's name directly
        instead of relying on the macro, and by not injecting the nudge at all on a non-primary
        turn (verified via the Prompt Inspector both broken and fixed). **Relationship tracking
        itself stopped being primary-only in #118** (10c) — a non-primary now scores and tracks
        their own affection/stats/gifts/gallery for real; choice suggestions and the in-character
        nudge line remain primary-gated exactly as described here, a deliberate scope line #118
        drew rather than a leftover gap.
      - **`DELETE /api/characters/:id`** now also scans every chat for that id as a *participant*
        (not just as primary) and strips it from `participants` rather than leaving a dangling
        reference — verified live: deleting a participant leaves the chat and its other participant
        intact; deleting the primary still deletes the chat as before.
      - **Deliberately cut, not silently missing**: VN mode still only ever shows the primary's
        sprite/expression, even mid-scene with a participant speaking (VNStage is built entirely
        around one character's sprite state — per-participant sprites is a separate, larger lift);
        ~~no `Scene` entity (location/objective/atmosphere) and no AI-"director" turn policy~~ —
        built later, as #120, once multi-character relationship tracking (#118) gave manual group
        chats an actual reason to see real use; dates (10b) were NOT unified with this — kept as
        their own separate mechanic.
      5 new tests (`builder.test.ts`, covering per-turn speaker naming, the roster block, and
      `nextSpeakerName`), typecheck clean, full suite (86 tests) green. Verified live end-to-end
      with two real test characters: created a group chat, sent a message replying as each
      character in turn, confirmed `speakerId`/avatar/name all resolved correctly in the transcript,
      and confirmed via the Prompt Inspector that the assembled prompt correctly swaps identity
      blocks and roster depending on who's replying.
- [x] **A proper `Scene` entity + turn policies beyond manual** (#120) — closes out section 4/12's
      long-deferred item, picked up specifically because #118 (multi-character relationship
      tracking) gave manual group chats a real reason to see more use, which is exactly the
      condition this item's own deferral note was waiting on.
      - **Deliberately narrow scope**: `Scene` (`types.ts`) carries location/atmosphere framing plus
        a turn policy — genuinely new state — but *not* an objective, which stays on the existing
        `Objective`/`activeObjective` system rather than being duplicated. `Chat.scene?: Scene`,
        purely additive; unset behaves exactly like every chat that predates this (manual, no
        framing). Location/atmosphere fold into the same prompt slot `activeEvent.title`/
        `description` already use, independent of whether the chat even has a bound `World` — a
        plain group chat with no world at all can still say where it's happening.
      - **Four turn policies** (`src/lib/chat/scene.ts`, new — pure functions plus the one judge
        call): `'manual'` (today's exact "reply as" picker, untouched), `'round_robin'` (cycles the
        primary and every participant in a fixed order; the bookkeeping index is read defensively —
        modulo, not trusted — so a roster that's since shrunk can't produce an invalid pick),
        `'mention'` (an `@Name` in the player's own message routes the reply there, longest-name-
        first so "Aria" can't shadow "Aria Kestrel," word-boundary matched so "@Ari" can't hit
        "Aria"), and `'director'` (a cheap classification call — same "model plays the character,
        code applies the result" shape as `assessRelationshipMoment` — reads the scene and picks who
        would naturally respond). `'mention'`/`'director'` both fall back to the primary on no
        match/any failure, never leaving a reply unattributed.
      - **Gift-giving deliberately stays independent of the turn policy** — an explicit "give this
        to them" action shouldn't get silently redirected by round-robin or an AI director, so it
        keeps following the composer's "reply as" choice regardless of what policy is active (the
        one place the two can genuinely diverge).
      - **UI**: a new "Scene" toolbar entry (hidden until a chat actually has participants, same
        gating the "reply as" picker already uses) opens `ScenePanel.tsx` for location/atmosphere/
        policy. Once a non-`'manual'` policy is active, the composer's own "reply as" `<select>`
        gives way to a read-only hint (`Next: {name}` for round-robin, a one-line explainer for the
        other two) — there's nothing left to manually pick.
      - **Caught one real bug live, not in review**: the `TuningPanel` slide-over (a much earlier
        session item) used `translate-x-full` to sit off-screen when closed — a `transform` moves an
        element visually but its box still counts toward an ancestor's scrollable area, so the
        "hidden" panel was quietly widening the whole page into a permanent horizontal scrollbar you
        could scroll to reveal it through. Unrelated to this item's own code, found while verifying
        it live in the same session; fixed with `overflow-hidden` on the `ChatWindow` root the panel
        docks to (the `<Modal>` shell and `ReactivePortrait` both use `position: fixed`/their own
        nested wrapper, neither clipped by a plain `overflow` on an ancestor with no transform of
        its own, so nothing else needed touching).
      11 new tests (`scene.test.ts`): round-robin's start/advance/wrap/stale-index/empty-roster
      cases, mention's longest-match/case-insensitivity/word-boundary/no-match cases, and the roster
      builder. Full suite (474 tests at the time), typecheck, and build all clean. **Verified live
      end-to-end** with a real throwaway participant added to the seeded Sumire chat (koboldcpp off,
      so `'director'`'s own model call failed exactly the way it was designed to survive): set
      round-robin and sent two messages, confirming the reply alternated Sumire → Kestrel with
      `speakerId` set correctly on the second and the composer's "Next:" hint updating each time,
      including a stale-index wrap back to Sumire; switched to `'mention'` and confirmed an
      `@Sumire` in a message correctly overrode what would otherwise have been the "next" speaker,
      and that a message with no mention fell back to the primary; switched to `'director'` and, via
      a patched `fetch`, captured the judge call's own prompt (correctly naming both characters and
      the scene's location) and confirmed its failure (no model reachable) fell back to the primary
      rather than leaving the reply unattributed; confirmed the scene's location/atmosphere reached
      the *actual reply* prompt, not just the director's own judge call. Deleted the test character
      afterward and confirmed the existing participant-cleanup cascade correctly emptied
      `participants` while leaving the chat intact; reverted every other mutation (messages, scene,
      pin state) and diffed the chat back to its exact pre-test snapshot. A plain single-character
      chat was re-verified afterward to show no "Scene" entry and no turn-policy hint at all — the
      gating holds.
- [x] **Message search across a chat or across all chats** — a 🔎 header button opens
      `SearchPanel.tsx` with a "This chat" / "All chats" toggle. In-chat search filters the
      already-loaded `messages` client-side (instant, no round trip); all-chats search hits a new
      debounced `GET /api/messages/search?q=` (`messagesApi.search()`) — a plain JS substring scan
      over the whole table server-side rather than a SQL `LIKE`, so it never has to add the JSON
      `data` blob column to `assertSafeClause`'s identifier allowlist for what is a read-only,
      non-performance-critical feature on a single-user local database. Cross-chat results are
      labeled `{character} — {chat title}` by joining against `chats`/`characters`
      (`useApiQuery`, already-cached). Clicking a result jumps to it: in the current chat that's a
      scroll-to + 2.2s highlight flash; in another chat it switches `activeChatId` (no deep-scroll
      across the chat-switch boundary — a deliberate simplification, see below).
- [x] **Bookmarks/pinned messages for favorite moments** — `StoredMessage.pinned?: boolean`
      (`types.ts`), toggled via a ☆/★ button next to regenerate/fork/delete on every message
      (`MessageBubble.tsx`, `VNStage.tsx`'s own quick-view header). Unlike the rest of that action
      row, the pin itself stays visible at rest (next to the sender's name) rather than only on
      hover — otherwise there'd be no way to spot favorited moments while scrolling. A ★ header
      button opens `PinnedMessagesPanel.tsx`, listing every pinned message in the chat with a
      one-click jump (scroll-to + highlight) or unpin.
      - **Shared "jump to message" mechanism** (`src/lib/scrollToMessage.ts`) built once for both
        features above: every message bubble carries a stable `#msg-{id}` anchor; jumping sets a
        `highlightedId` in `ChatWindow` that scrolls it into view and fades a `bg-accent/10` tint
        for ~2.2s. VN mode needed its own handling since its backlog transcript is a collapsed
        drawer (`VNStage.tsx`'s `showLog`) — a jump opens the drawer first, then scrolls once it's
        actually mounted, as two separate effects (open, then scroll-once-open).
      - **Deliberately simpler than the full idea**: a cross-chat search/jump only switches chats,
        it doesn't also deep-scroll to the specific message in the newly-opened chat (the target
        chat's own `ChatWindow` instance remounts fresh with no highlight target carried over).
        Revisit if that gap turns out to matter in practice.
      Verified live end-to-end: pin persists and shows on both message-list styles and VN mode,
      unpins correctly, in-chat and cross-chat search both return correct/correctly-labeled
      results, cross-chat jump switches chats. Typecheck clean, full suite (81 tests) green.
- [x] **Chat export as a readable HTML transcript** — a "↓" header button builds a fully
      standalone `.html` file (`src/lib/export/chatTranscript.ts`) via `buildChatTranscriptHtml()`
      + `downloadChatTranscript()`: a dark, VN-log-styled page with alternating char/user rows,
      avatars, and any message image attachments, that opens correctly in any browser with the
      app's server not even running. Avatars are inlined as data URLs (reusing `urlToDataUrl()`
      from `pack.ts`, exported for this); `StoredMessage.images` are already full data URLs
      (`useChatSession.ts`'s `sendUserMessage`), so those need no conversion. All user/model text
      is HTML-escaped — verified live with a message containing `<script>`, `&`, and quote
      characters, all rendered inert in the output. Filename derived from the chat title.

## 5. Aesthetic polish (anime/manga mood)
- [x] **Manga/anime-flavored font pairing** — self-hosted `@fontsource/zen-maru-gothic` (500/700
      weights, matching the existing self-hosted-Inter, no-external-font-requests convention)
      alongside the current Inter-only stack, via a new `--font-display` token and `.font-display`
      utility class (`globals.css`). Deliberately scoped to character name-plates only — the
      `ChatWindow` header name, `MessageBubble`'s sender name (document/flat styles), and
      `VNStage`'s VN dialogue-box name-plate — not swept across editor/settings chrome, which
      stays plain Inter; a tool's own UI shouldn't wear the same costume as the characters inside
      it. Verified live: confirmed the font actually loads (`document.fonts`, not just declared
      and silently falling back) and resolves correctly on all three name-plate surfaces.
- [x] **Shipped 2 additional theme presets: "Sakura" and "Neon Night"** — `src/lib/store/
      themePresets.ts` defines each as a full light+dark token pair; a new "Presets" row at the top
      of `ThemeEditor.tsx` applies one with a single click via the same `setThemeToken()` the
      color-swatch pickers use, so every value stays hand-editable afterward, same as any
      hand-tuned theme. Deliberately narrower than applying a full saved theme (`themesApi`/
      "Apply"): a preset only touches the 11 color tokens, not `chatStyle`/`avatarShape`/layout/
      `customCss` — picking a palette shouldn't silently reach into unrelated settings. Sakura is a
      soft pink/plum romance palette; Neon Night a vivid magenta cyberpunk one — both verified live
      in both light and dark mode (the swatch preview, the applied `--c-accent` value, and the
      whole app's re-themed look all checked, then reset back to the default teal).
- [x] **`*action text*`/"quoted dialogue" emphasis** — done, the smaller and more broadly useful
      half of this item (the "manga-style SFX text bursts" half stays open below, as a separate,
      more decorative treatment). `.prose-rp em`/`.rp-quote` CSS already existed in `globals.css`
      unused — nothing had ever produced those tags, so every message rendered with literal
      asterisks and no visual distinction between narration and speech. A new
      `splitMessageSegments()` (`src/lib/text/messageSegments.ts`) is the single source of truth
      for the split, walked via `matchAll` rather than `String.split` + re-inspecting each piece's
      own first/last character — the latter misclassifies an unterminated `*action` (whose
      leftover text coincidentally starts and ends with `*`) as a real match even though nothing
      actually matched the delimiter pattern; a real bug caught by a deliberately adversarial test
      case before it ever reached the UI. `renderMessageText()` (`messageText.tsx`) is the JSX
      wrapper used by `MessageBubble` (all three chat styles) and `VNStage`'s dialogue box, and
      `messageTextHtml()` in `chatTranscript.ts` reuses the same parser for the HTML export so all
      three surfaces agree. VNStage gets its own `.vn-dialogue em`/`.rp-quote` colors rather than
      reusing `.prose-rp`'s, since its dialogue box sits on a background image with fixed white
      text, not a themed surface. Caught and fixed two real `*/`-inside-a-comment bugs along the
      way (one in a JSDoc comment, one in a CSS comment) where a stray `*/` inside prose describing
      the asterisk convention silently truncated the surrounding comment block. 8 unit tests cover
      the parser (plain text, action, quote, mixed, unterminated asterisk, lone asterisk, no match
      across newlines, empty string); verified live end-to-end (a message with both action and
      quote segments, computed styles confirmed distinct in both the default chat style and VN
      mode, test data cleaned up).
- [x] **Manga-style SFX text bursts** — done (#98). A standalone onomatopoeia clause ("BOOM!",
      "knock knock", "KA-CHUNK") is now a fourth segment type from the same `splitMessageSegments()`
      parser, so every surface that already rendered `*action*`/`"quote"` (all three chat styles,
      the VN dialogue box, the VN backlog, the HTML transcript export) picks it up with no extra
      wiring. Detection is a second pass over the plain/action segments only — never inside
      `"quotes"`, where a "BOOM!" is something a character *said* — that tags a clause standing on
      its own between sentence punctuation/dashes/newlines when it's nothing but words from a
      curated ~90-entry onomatopoeia list. The list is deliberately tight: shouted non-sounds
      ("STOP", "NO", "HELP") and inflected verb forms ("the door SLAMS shut") are left out by
      design, and elongated spellings ("KABOOOOM") collapse to a dictionary hit. Styling is
      restrained — display face, heavier weight, tracked-out, accent-coloured — not the huge rotated
      lettering of a real panel, which would wreck line layout in a chat bubble; the one place it
      gets theatre is the VN dialogue box (`.vn-dialogue .rp-sfx`: white with a rose glow and a
      150ms `sfx-pop` scale-in, both dropped under reduced-motion). Chat mode stays static — it's a
      scroll-back log, not a scene. 9 new parser tests (lone burst, mid-sentence burst keeping its
      surrounding text, repeated lowercase as a whole action segment, dash-delimited burst,
      elongated spelling, a shouted non-sound left alone, a verb form left alone, a spoken "BOOM!"
      in quotes left alone, and no-op output-shape parity for a message with no SFX). Verified live:
      "BANG!"/"THUD"/"KA-CHUNK"/"WHIRR"/"THUMP" all render as bursts with the right computed styles
      in chat and VN, reduced-motion disables the VN animation, and a normal message with no sound
      words is byte-identical to before. ~~The **speech-bubble-tails** half of the original item stays
      open~~ — done in #101.
      **Made opt-in and per-character customizable (#99)** after the first cut shipped always-on
      with a hardcoded list. `splitMessageSegments(text, sfx?)` now takes an `SfxConfig`
      (`{ disabled?, extraWords? }`): a global **Settings → Appearance → "Sound-effect bursts"**
      toggle (default on) plus a global "Extra sound words" field, and a per-character
      `Character.sfxWords` list on the Visual novel tab — so a catgirl adds "nya, nyaa, mrrp" and an
      imouto her own tics, styled only in *her* messages. `sfxConfigFor(msg, …)` (pure, in
      `src/lib/text/sfx.ts`, 6 tests) resolves the speaker: a group-chat participant's `speakerId`
      wins over the primary, user messages get the global list only, a persona has no vocabulary.
      Extra words are punctuation/casing/elongation-normalised the same way built-ins are ("nya"
      also catches "Nyaa~"). Carried by `.rppack.json`; server-validated with `normalizeStringArray`.
      13 new tests (281 total). Verified live end-to-end: toggle off removes all bursts while the
      raw text stays, a global word lights up in every character's messages, a per-character word
      lights up only for that character (checked against the real modules with the seeded Sumire),
      and the character-editor field round-trips through the API.
- [x] Subtle ambient particle/gradient effects (e.g. optional falling sakura petals layer) behind
      `VNStage` — currently a static background image only. See changelog #50.
- [x] **Polish `WorldsView`/`CharacterList` portrait grids with hover glow/parallax** — a shared
      `.portrait-frame` class (`globals.css`) wraps each grid's portrait art: a soft accent-colored
      glow ring appears around the frame on hover, and the art itself zooms in gently (1.06x),
      contained by the frame so it never spills past the rounded corners — a cheap depth cue
      alongside the card's existing lift-on-hover, short of real cursor-tracking tilt/parallax
      (deliberately not attempted — heavier, more fragile for a small grid, and it's the "glow"
      half of this item that reads as the finished, useful piece; "parallax" is approximated rather
      than built literally). Both grids' markup restructured identically (`CharacterList.tsx`,
      `WorldsView.tsx`) so the effect and its reduced-motion handling live in one place, not
      duplicated per view. Respects both the app's own `reducedMotion` setting (the existing
      `:root.reduced-motion *` global override already zeroes these transitions) and the OS-level
      `prefers-reduced-motion` media query, matching the convention set by `.cursor-blink`/
      `.vn-sprite-bob`. Verified live: computed `boxShadow`/`transform` confirmed present only on
      the actually-hovered card and absent on others, in both grids.

## 6. Audio/ambience
- [x] **Background music per world/scene mood** — done (#100). Mood-keyed rather than
      location-keyed, as the item wanted: `SceneTag` gained an optional `mood` (9 built-ins in
      `src/lib/vn/moods.ts` — tender, romantic, cheerful, playful, lively, calm, dreamy, tense,
      somber), the model tags each VN reply with one *only when the world has music* (no prompt-token
      cost otherwise — `sceneOptions.moodIds` is passed conditionally, `buildSceneInstruction`
      appends the `mood=ID` field and list). `WorldCard.music: Record<string,string>` holds one
      looping track URL per mood plus a `default`; `resolveBgmTrack()` (`src/lib/audio/bgm.ts`, 7
      tests) picks tagged-mood → location-implied-mood fallback → `default` → silence, so it works
      with KoboldCpp off (no mood tags ever emitted → always the `default` loop, the item's own
      "one static per-world loop" baseline).
      - **Player** (`BgmPlayer.tsx`): a hidden pair of looping `<audio>` elements that crossfade
        (1.4s) on any track change, driven by a wall-clock `setInterval` rather than `rAF` (which a
        background tab pauses outright, freezing a fade half-done — found live). Fully idempotent so
        React StrictMode's double-invoke and mid-fade prop changes just re-converge.
      - **Placement**: `GlobalBgm` mounts once in `App.tsx` above the view switch, resolving the
        world straight from `activeChatId` and the scene from `useBgmSceneStore` (published by
        `ChatWindow`) — so a track keeps playing while you dip into Settings to adjust the volume.
        Companion mode runs its own instance against its own separately-chosen chat.
      - **Volume / ducking**: `bgmVolume` slider in Settings → Appearance, **default 0** — nothing
        plays or even asks the browser to unlock audio until it's raised (which is itself the
        unlocking gesture). `useAudioDuckStore` drops it to ~22% while Companion mode's TTS speaks.
      - **Storage**: `resolveWorldMusicMap()` (`server/avatars.ts`, a generalised `resolveMediaMap`)
        writes uploads to `data/avatars/worlds/<id>/music/<mood>.<ext>` (MP3/OGG/WAV/WebM/AAC/M4A,
        25MB cap, unreferenced files pruned) — so the recursive backup walk and per-world folder
        delete cover it for free. Carried by `.rppack.json`. Upload slots (one per mood + Default)
        in the World editor → Scenes tab.
      Verified live end-to-end with a generated test tone: upload → file on disk → served with the
      right mime; `default` loop plays on chat open; a message tagged `mood=tender` crossfades to
      `tender.wav`; volume slider glides and persists music across a view switch to Settings;
      duck drops the level; zero fades out and pauses both elements; the whole feature is inert
      with `bgmVolume` at its default 0. 296 tests, typecheck, build green.
- [x] **Optional UI SFX (message-send blip, notification chime) with a `reducedAudio` setting** —
      done. `src/lib/audio/sfx.ts` synthesizes both sounds with WebAudio (short sine-tone envelopes
      via `OscillatorNode`/`GainNode`) rather than shipping audio files — nothing to source/license,
      nothing added to the bundle, and it degrades silently (try/catch, no-op with no `AudioContext`)
      instead of ever risking breaking a send. The blip fires from `sendUserMessage` in
      `useChatSession.ts`, right after the empty-message guard. The chime is wired through
      `toastSuccess(message, { chime: true })` — a new optional second argument, defaulting to
      falsy, since most success toasts (coins earned, a chat forked) are mundane and would turn a
      chime into noise; `chime: true` is set only at the genuine reward moments: a relationship
      stage-up, a gallery/ending unlock, a commitment-ask accepted, and a relationship stabilizing
      after a breakup warning — the same set of moments that already got the "Milestone/unlock
      toasts" treatment in section 2. `reducedAudio` (`useSettingsStore.ts`) mutes both, added next
      to `reducedMotion` in Settings → Appearance, matching its naming and default (off — sound
      plays by default, same as motion). Verified live: toggled the setting and confirmed it
      persists, sent a real chat message and confirmed the send path runs clean with no console
      errors, and confirmed `AudioContext`/`OscillatorNode` work correctly in this app's actual
      browser context.

## 7. Data, backup, sharing
- [x] One-click full backup/restore: `GET /api/backup` snapshots every table (with original ids)
      plus every file under `data/avatars` (inlined as base64) into one JSON file;
      `POST /api/restore` wipes and reloads every table and file from it. Exposed as
      "Download backup" / "Restore from backup…" in Settings → Data (`DataSettings.tsx`), with a
      hard confirmation before restore since it's destructive and irreversible. Deliberately
      separate from character packs (`pack.ts`), which mint new ids for sharing a single
      character rather than reproducing the whole install.
- [x] **Avatar/sprite/CG/background folder structure reorganized to nest per-entity** — was a flat
      `data/avatars/<kind>/` per image type (`characters/`, `sprites/`, `gallery/`, `worlds/`,
      `backgrounds/`, `personas/`), every character's/world's images distinguished only by an
      id-prefixed filename (`<charId>_happy.png`) sitting alongside every other character's. Now
      everything belonging to one character or world lives under one folder for that entity —
      `data/avatars/characters/<id>/{avatar, sprites/*, gallery/*}` and
      `data/avatars/worlds/<id>/{avatar, backgrounds/*}` — browsable as a single unit in a real
      file manager. Personas stay flat (`data/avatars/personas/<id>.<ext>`) since they never have
      more than the one image. `server/avatars.ts`'s `resolveAvatar`/`resolveAvatarMap` do the path
      construction; `removeAvatarMap` no longer exists at all — deleting a character or world now
      just recursively removes its one folder (avatar + every sprite/gallery/background together),
      which is simpler than the three separate removal calls this used to take and can't leave
      anything orphaned. Nothing else needed to change: `express.static` already serves arbitrary
      nesting, and both backup/restore (`listAvatarFiles()`'s recursive walk) and character-pack
      export (`pack.ts`'s `urlToDataUrl`) were already structure-agnostic — they mirror or fetch
      whatever's there rather than assuming a layout. No migration needed since no character/world
      had ever saved a real image before this landed. Verified live: uploaded real image data for
      an avatar + two sprites + a gallery CG on a test character, confirmed every resulting URL
      resolved (200) and matched the new nested paths on disk, then confirmed deleting the
      character removed the entire per-character folder in one shot; repeated for a world
      (avatar + background) and a persona (still flat).
- [x] Character/world "packs" export/import (`src/lib/characters/pack.ts`, `.rppack.json`) bundle
      the card, sprites, gallery CGs, `spriteUnlocks`, `giftPreferences`, and the bound world
      (description/rules/lorebook/backgrounds) into one file, inlining every server-hosted image
      as a data URL so nothing is lost when sharing outside this app instance. Wired into
      `CharacterEditor` as "Export pack" (existing characters) / "Import pack" (new character
      screen). The bare SillyTavern-spec PNG/JSON export/import is unchanged and still used for
      cross-app compatibility.
- [x] Grow the pack format to match section 10 — done incrementally as each feature shipped rather
      than in one pass, so this checkbox was stale: `CharacterPackV1` already carries schedules
      (`Character.schedule`), gift preferences/likes, weather preferences, relationship starters,
      social connections, and (on the world side) the gift/item catalogs and relationship
      thresholds — checked directly in `pack.ts` rather than assumed. "Typed memories" from this
      item's original wording doesn't actually fit a reusable template pack the way the rest does:
      `ChatFact`s are accumulated per-chat runtime history, not authored character/world data, so
      there's nothing there to bundle into a pack meant to travel to someone else's fresh install.

## 8. Backend/AI
- [x] **Gemma + Llama 3 instruct templates, and detect a template mismatch** (#106) — the app
      shipped 5 builtins (plain-chat/alpaca/vicuna/chatml/mistral) with `plain-chat` as the default,
      and `builder.ts` never applied `systemPrefix`/`systemSuffix` at all — so even picking the right
      builtin left the whole system+description+persona block floating as loose text outside any
      turn. User hit this hard with a Gemma-family model (`Heimdallr-26B-A4B`): fed a name-prefixed
      transcript with no turn markers and (`plain-chat`) no stop sequences, it rambled, broke
      character, emitted raw `<i>`/`<b>` tags, invented and "resolved" fake instructions, narrated
      "looking at the prompt…", and never stopped. Fixes: (1) new `gemma` and `llama3` builtins;
      (2) `builder.ts` now wraps the entire fixed block in `template.systemPrefix`/`systemSuffix`
      (no-op for `plain-chat`, which leaves them empty); (3) `detectInstructTemplateId()` maps the
      model's own chat template (KoboldCpp `/props` → `chat_template`, best-effort via new
      `KoboldClient.getChatTemplate()`) to a builtin id, surfaced by `useConnectionStatus` and shown
      in Settings → Connection as a one-click "Switch to {name}" nudge whenever it disagrees with the
      active builtin. 9 new tests (379 total). Verified live: the mismatch banner correctly
      identified Gemma; switching templates turned the exact broken "Who am I?" reply into a clean,
      in-character, persona-aware line ("What kind of question is that? We go to the same
      university. I've seen you in the cafeteria.").
- [x] **Instruct-template library from SillyTavern presets** (#107) — the user dropped ST's whole
      preset library into `presets/` and asked for it "implemented neatly". Rather than a 46-entry
      dropdown:
      - **Builtins expanded to 12, converted from ST's own sequence definitions**: plain-chat,
        ChatML, Gemma, Llama 3, Mistral v1–v3, Mistral v7, Command R, DeepSeek, Metharme/Pygmalion,
        Phi, Alpaca, Vicuna. All structured formats now carry a `{name}: ` speaker prefix and
        `namesInPrompt: true`, matching ST's default `names_behavior: "force"` — a roleplay model
        tracks speakers far better with names in the turn, and `cleanModelOutput` strips the echo.
        `detectInstructTemplateId` gained patterns for the new families.
      - **Import path for the long tail**: `sillyTavernPreset.ts`'s `parseSillyTavernPreset()`
        converts an ST `instruct/*.json` to an `InstructTemplate` (handles `wrap`, `{{name}}`
        sequences, `story_string_prefix`, force-names) or an ST `sysprompt/*.json` to prompt +
        post-history text; flags context/sampler presets as unsupported with a reason. "Import ST
        preset" `FileButton`s in the Instruct-template and System-prompt sections (multi-file for
        instruct) turn any downloaded preset into a custom template / loaded prompt.
      - **`cleanModelOutput` now also normalises HTML formatting** — models trained on scraped chat
        data emit `<i>…</i>`/`<b>…</b>` (and, when confused, `<b><i><i></b>` salad) instead of
        `*asterisks*`; well-formed pairs convert to markdown, the rest is stripped. A bare `<` in
        prose ("x < y") is left alone.
      - `presets/` is now gitignored and excluded from Vite's file watcher (it had crashed the dev
        server with `EBUSY` on a locked file).
      11 new tests (390 total), typecheck + build clean. Verified live on `Heimdallr-26B-A4B`
      (Gemma): names-forced Gemma keeps Sumire fully in character across several turns, and a reply
      the model wrote with `<i>` tags stores as clean `*action*` markdown.
- [x] **Additional model backends alongside KoboldCpp-only `KoboldClient`** (#121) — closes out
      section 8. User's own framing going in: "I can't verify additional model backends since I
      don't have any other APIs" — built and tested to that honest constraint first (documented
      contract + mocked tests, explicitly *not* claimed as live-verified), then genuinely
      live-verified against a real hosted provider once the user made a free OpenRouter account
      specifically to check it — see the verification bullet below for both halves.
      - **`ChatBackend`** ([src/lib/api/chatBackend.ts](src/lib/api/chatBackend.ts)) — the same "one
        interface, many providers" shape `ttsProviders.ts` already uses for TTS: `generate`,
        `generateStream`, `getEffectiveMaxContext`, `tokenCount`, `abort`, `getChatTemplate`.
        `KoboldClient` now `implements ChatBackend` (structural conformance checked at compile
        time, not just assumed); new **`OpenAICompatibleClient`**
        ([src/lib/api/openaiCompatible.ts](src/lib/api/openaiCompatible.ts)) is the other
        implementation — deliberately one client for the whole OpenAI Chat Completions wire format
        rather than four bespoke ones, since OpenRouter alone re-exposes Claude/Gemini/etc. through
        this exact shape: one implementation covers OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Together, and local
        OpenAI-shim servers (LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp's own `--api`).
      - **Reconciling the two prompt paradigms**: every call site in this app builds one flat,
        instruct-template-formatted `prompt: string` for KoboldCpp's text-completion API — nothing
        like a hosted `{role, content}[]` messages array. Rather than rewriting the ~15 call sites
        that build ad-hoc judge-call prompts as flat strings, `GenerateRequest` gained an optional
        `messages?: ChatCompletionMessage[]` ([src/lib/api/types.ts](src/lib/api/types.ts)):
        `KoboldClient` ignores it entirely; `OpenAICompatibleClient` sends it as-is when present,
        else falls back to wrapping `prompt` as a single user turn — so every background judge/
        assist call (relationship scoring, choice suggestion, objective planning, outreach
        messages, VN scene vision, character generation/regeneration, lore suggestions) works
        against a hosted backend completely unchanged, just without a system/user split. The one
        call site worth that split — the main chat generation loop — gets it: `PromptBuildResult`
        now separately exposes `systemText`/`conversationText`
        ([src/lib/prompt/builder.ts](src/lib/prompt/builder.ts), the same two pieces already joined
        into `prompt`), and `runGeneration` ([src/lib/hooks/useChatSession.ts](src/lib/hooks/useChatSession.ts))
        passes them as a proper `[{role:'system',…},{role:'user',…}]` pair alongside the unchanged
        `prompt` fallback.
      - **The whole app respects the Settings choice, not just the main chat loop**: a new
        `createChatBackend()` factory
        ([src/lib/api/createChatBackend.ts](src/lib/api/createChatBackend.ts)) and
        `useChatBackendClient()` hook
        ([src/lib/hooks/useChatBackendClient.ts](src/lib/hooks/useChatBackendClient.ts)) replaced
        every `new KoboldClient(baseUrl)` call site — `useChatSession.ts`, `GenerateCharacterDialog`,
        `RegenerateFieldButton`, `ChatsPanel`/`NewChatDialog`'s greeting generation, `LorebookEditor`'s
        "Suggest with AI", and `useOutreachTick`'s background world-tick — with the ~10 judge/assist
        functions underneath them (`relationshipAssist.ts`, `choices.ts`, `objectiveAssist.ts`,
        `aiAssist.ts`, `outreach.ts`, `sceneVision.ts`, `scene.ts`, `rapport.ts`) widened from a
        `KoboldClient`-typed parameter to `ChatBackend`. The one deliberate exception:
        `useConnectionStatus`'s Settings → Connection health check stays KoboldCpp-specific — it
        reports the local server's own version/model/chat-template, a concept a hosted API has no
        equivalent of.
      - **Settings UI**: a new "Chat generation backend" section in Settings → Connection
        ([src/components/settings/ConnectionSettings.tsx](src/components/settings/ConnectionSettings.tsx)),
        below the existing KoboldCpp connection block — a backend picker plus base URL/API key/model
        fields for `'openai-compatible'`, defaulting to `'koboldcpp'` so no existing setup changes
        unless a user opts in. New settings-store fields
        (`chatBackend`/`chatBackendBaseUrl`/`chatBackendApiKey`/`chatBackendModel`,
        `setChatBackendConfig`) mirror the flat `ttsProvider`/`ttsApiKey`/`ttsBaseUrl` shape already
        established for TTS.
      - **Verification, in two honest stages**. First pass, before anyone had a real key: built to
        the documented OpenAI Chat Completions contract plus 17 new mocked-`fetch` unit tests
        ([src/lib/api/openaiCompatible.test.ts](src/lib/api/openaiCompatible.test.ts)) — request-body
        shape (messages wrapping vs. pass-through, KoboldCpp-only fields correctly dropped,
        `max_length`→`max_tokens`/`stop_sequence`→`stop` mapping), the `Authorization` header,
        SSE-stream parsing (`delta.content` chunks, the `[DONE]` sentinel, malformed/keepalive
        events), error handling (a parsed provider error message, an aborted-vs.-unreachable
        distinction), and every no-op fallback (`getEffectiveMaxContext` returning the caller's
        fallback, `tokenCount` using the same character-estimate the rest of the app already falls
        back to, `getChatTemplate` returning null) — plus, in the running app with `fetch`
        monkey-patched to a fake endpoint, confirming switching Settings to `'openai-compatible'`
        and sending a real chat message produced the exact expected request shape end to end.
        491 tests total, typecheck and build clean.

        Second pass, genuinely live: the user made a free OpenRouter account specifically to check
        this and handed over a real key for `minimax/minimax-m3:free`. Configured through the actual
        Settings UI (not a shortcut) and run against three real turns of the seeded Sumire chat:
        streaming worked end to end (real `tok/s`/first-token-latency/context-used numbers in the
        HUD), replies came back fully in-character and well-formed (a tsundere architecture student
        citing a real building — "St. Giles, Cheadle. Pugin, 1846" — then catching herself and
        deflecting, unprompted), and both background judge calls fired correctly against the same
        backend: relationship scoring advanced the stage tracker, and choice suggestions came back
        contextually relevant each turn. One anomaly worth recording plainly: the very first live
        attempt streamed to a clean `finish_reason: "stop"` with completely empty `content` — not
        reproduced on either follow-up attempt (both fully successful on the first try), and nothing
        in this client's own code path distinguishes attempt 1 from attempts 2–3, so a transient
        upstream hiccup on OpenRouter's free-tier routing (the raw SSE opened with `: OPENROUTER
        PROCESSING` keepalive comments, suggesting queuing behind other free-tier traffic) is far
        more likely than a client bug — but it wasn't chased down further, so treat an occasional
        silent-empty reply on a free-tier model as a known possibility, not a ruled-out one. This
        confirms the `OpenAICompatibleClient` implementation against a real, independent
        implementation of the wire format (OpenRouter's own gateway, not OpenAI's servers) — direct
        OpenAI/Groq/Together/local-shim endpoints, and any paid model, remain exercised only by the
        mocked tests above. The test conversation was rewound afterward to leave the real chat
        history clean; the one artifact left behind is a harmless `+1` to that chat's relationship
        score, since rewinding a message doesn't revert relationship deltas — not worth chasing for
        one point at "near strangers."
- [x] **Provider picker + native chat-completion generation settings** (#122) — direct follow-up to
      #121, prompted by the user sharing SillyTavern's own Connection/preset screenshots with the
      closing observation "text completion and chat completion presets are different." Two pieces,
      plus a real bug the second one surfaced:
      - **Provider picker** — `KNOWN_CHAT_PROVIDERS` ([src/lib/api/chatBackend.ts](src/lib/api/chatBackend.ts)):
        eleven named providers (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, Together AI, Fireworks
        AI, Google AI Studio, xAI, local LM Studio, local Ollama), each vendor's own documented base
        URL. A new "Provider" `SelectField` in Settings → Connection resolves its displayed value by
        matching the current Base URL against this list (falls back to no selection — treated as
        "Custom" — when it doesn't match anything, the same "derive from live state" idiom the
        sampler/instruct-template presets already use elsewhere in Settings) and picking one just
        fills in the Base URL field; the Model field's placeholder updates to that provider's own
        example model id too. Honesty carried over from #121: only OpenRouter's entry has actually
        been exercised against a real account — the rest are correct per each vendor's docs, not
        independently re-verified here.
      - **Native chat-completion generation settings** — a new `ChatCompletionSamplerParams`
        ([src/lib/api/types.ts](src/lib/api/types.ts)): `temperature`/`top_p`/`frequency_penalty`/
        `presence_penalty` plus `reasoningEffort` and `verbosity` (both `'auto'`, omitting the field
        entirely, by default — genuinely relevant now that the live #121 test ran a reasoning model).
        Stored as its own `chatCompletionSampler` settings-store field, deliberately separate from
        `sampler` (the KoboldCpp `GenerationParams` shape) so switching `chatBackend` back and forth
        never clobbers either one's tuning. A new **`ChatCompletionSamplerSection`**
        ([src/components/settings/ChatCompletionSamplerSection.tsx](src/components/settings/ChatCompletionSamplerSection.tsx))
        replaces the KoboldCpp "Generation" section (Starting point/Creativity-Focus-Avoid-repetition/
        Advanced mode) in Settings → Generation whenever `chatBackend` is `'openai-compatible'`, and
        the Quick Tuning slide-over (`TuningPanel.tsx`) gets the same swap. The KoboldCpp-only
        Instruct-template section and the sampler-preset save/export/import section are hidden
        entirely in this mode rather than shown irrelevant or silently no-op.
      - **A real bug this surfaced**: building the "native" settings meant actually looking at what
        `systemText`/`conversationText` (added in #121) contain, and it turned out the active
        instruct template's own reserved tokens were baked in — `builder.ts`'s `fixedText` wraps the
        whole system block in `template.systemPrefix`/`systemSuffix`, and every history turn carries
        `template.userPrefix`/`assistantPrefix`. For ChatML that's literally the strings
        `<|im_start|>system\n...<|im_end|>\n` inside the JSON `content` field sent to a real hosted
        API — invisible in #121's own testing only because the live account happened to be running
        `plain-chat`, whose affixes are empty. Fixed in `useChatSession.ts`: the template used to
        build the prompt is forced to the token-free, name-prefixed `plain-chat` builtin whenever
        `chatBackend` is `'openai-compatible'`, regardless of what the user has instruct-template set
        to for KoboldCpp — a hosted chat-completion API formats its own turns and has no use for
        KoboldCpp's turn-boundary tokens anyway. Re-verified live: with the settings' own instruct
        template deliberately set to ChatML, three real chat-completion requests against the same
        OpenRouter account confirmed zero `<|im_start|>`/`<|im_end|>` in either message's content.
      3 new tests (`chatCompletionSampler.test.ts`, plus two more in `openaiCompatible.test.ts` for
      the three new mapped fields), 495 total, typecheck and build clean. The user independently
      hand-tested the same live setup in parallel with a real extended exchange (gift-giving,
      several back-and-forth turns, relationship score climbing normally) — the best validation of
      the three "live" checks so far, since it's genuine unscripted use rather than a scripted probe.
- [x] **NovelAI as a third `ChatBackend`** (#123) — the user's own SillyTavern screenshots showed
      "NovelAI" as a peer of "Text Completion" and "Chat Completion," not a variant of either, with
      a direct link to `docs.novelai.net`. Investigating that turned into the most research-heavy
      integration in section 8, including a real correction mid-build:
      - **It's a text-completion API, architecturally** — `POST https://text.novelai.net/ai/generate`
        (Kayra) or `https://api.novelai.net/ai/generate` (Clio), `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, a
        flat `input` string plus a `parameters` object — much closer to `KoboldClient` than to
        `OpenAICompatibleClient`. `NovelAIClient` ([src/lib/api/novelai.ts](src/lib/api/novelai.ts))
        implements `ChatBackend` and deliberately reuses the existing KoboldCpp-shaped `sampler`
        settings directly (`temperature`/`top_p`/`top_k`/`top_a`/`min_p`/`typical`→`typical_p`/
        `tfs`→`tail_free_sampling`/`rep_pen`→`repetition_penalty`(`_range`/`_slope`)/
        `presence_penalty`/`mirostat_tau`/`mirostat_eta`→`mirostat_lr`) rather than the new
        chat-completion-native settings from #122 — NovelAI's own sampler zoo is close enough to
        KoboldCpp's that a translation layer was more honest than a second parallel settings UI.
        Settings UI: `chatBackend: 'novelai'` in the same picker as the other two, a Kayra/Clio
        model select, and an API key field, all in
        [ConnectionSettings.tsx](src/components/settings/ConnectionSettings.tsx).
      - **A real mid-build correction, caught before it shipped wrong**: the first working
        assumption (from `Aedial/novelai-api`, a well-established low-level Python reference client)
        was that the prompt must be tokenized with NovelAI's own tokenizer and sent as base64-packed
        token ids — a real, working design was most of the way built around that (a bundled
        SentencePiece WASM tokenizer, two ~1MB `.model` files, a server endpoint). Fetching
        SillyTavern's own actual, currently-shipping frontend source
        (`public/scripts/nai-settings.js`) at the user's own suggestion ("implement it how
        SillyTavern does") proved that assumption wrong: ST sends `input` as **plain text** with
        `use_string: true` for the main prompt, every time — the token-based path was real (NovelAI
        does support it) but wasn't the one actually needed. Caught before any of it reached
        production, but a genuine reminder that a plausible, internally-consistent-looking spec from
        one real reference client can still be the wrong path — cross-checking against a second,
        currently-working, more widely-used client caught it here.
      - **What the tokenizer work turned out to still be for**: NovelAI's `stop_sequences` and
        `bad_words_ids` parameters are documented as needing token ids, not strings, unlike every
        other backend in this app. The already-built tokenizer infrastructure was repurposed for
        exactly that narrower job instead of thrown away: `server/novelaiTokenizer.ts` bundles
        NovelAI's own official NerdStash v1 (Clio) / v2 (Kayra) SentencePiece models — downloaded
        from `huggingface.co/NovelAI/nerdstash-tokenizer-v{1,2}` with the user's explicit permission,
        stated file names/sources/sizes first — loaded via `@agnai/sentencepiece-js` (the same npm
        package SillyTavern itself depends on for this), served from a new
        `POST /api/novelai/tokenize` endpoint (`server/app.ts`). `NovelAIClient` calls it once per
        stop-sequence string before a real generation call, converting this app's universal
        `stop_sequence: string[]` into NovelAI's own `number[][]` shape; a tokenize failure (server
        unreachable, or a model with no bundled tokenizer) just means that call goes out with no stop
        sequences rather than failing the generation. Runs server-side rather than in the browser
        bundle — confirmed by the production build only growing ~4.5KB, not the ~2MB a bundled WASM
        tokenizer + two model files would have added.
      - **Deliberately unsupported**: **Erato** (NovelAI's newest model) needs a different,
        Llama-3-family tokenizer (`@agnai/web-tokenizers`, not SentencePiece) with no confirmed
        source found for its tokenizer file — `tokenizerForModel()` returns `null` for it rather than
        guessing, and it isn't offered in the model picker. **`bad_words_ids`/`logit_bias_exp`** —
        real NovelAI parameters SillyTavern fills with its own curated per-model anti-repetition/
        anti-asterisk presets, skipped here as polish rather than correctness. **The exact SSE
        streaming event format** — every source found details the request shape precisely; none
        pinned down `/ai/generate-stream`'s response shape (SillyTavern's own backend just pipes the
        raw stream through unparsed, and its frontend's actual parser wasn't reached before this
        needed to ship). `generateStream` guesses the same `data:` + `{token}` shape every other
        backend here already uses, with a safety net new to this client: a stream that closes having
        produced zero tokens automatically retries via the non-streaming endpoint, so a wrong
        guess here degrades to "works, just not incrementally" instead of "silently returns nothing."
      - **Verification, genuinely split down the middle**: the tokenizer half is fully, honestly
        verified — `server/novelaiTokenizer.test.ts` loads the real bundled `.model` files (not
        mocked) and checks real output: non-empty, deterministic, positive-integer token ids, longer
        text producing more tokens than a prefix of it. The generation half could not be verified at
        all — no NovelAI subscription was available this session — so `novelai.test.ts`'s 17 cases
        are mocked against the documented/reverse-engineered contract only: `use_string: true` and
        plain-text `input`, correct host selection per model, the full sampler field mapping, the
        stop-sequence tokenization round-trip (and its unreachable-server fallback), the zero-token
        streaming fallback, and error/abort handling. 520 tests total (34 files, `server/` now has
        its first-ever test coverage), typecheck and build clean. **This backend has not generated a
        single real token from NovelAI** — treat it as a stronger starting point than a guess, not as
        confirmed working; sanity-check the first real call before trusting it.
- [x] Surface actual max-context from the server info endpoint — `KoboldClient.getEffectiveMaxContext()`
      (`kobold.ts`) calls the existing `getTrueMaxContextLength()`, caches the result per client
      instance (one extra request, not one per judge call), and falls back to `4096` if the server
      is unreachable or doesn't support the endpoint. Every previously-hardcoded
      `max_context_length: 4096` in `relationshipAssist.ts`, `choices.ts`, `objectiveAssist.ts`,
      `aiAssist.ts` (×2), and `GenerateCharacterDialog.tsx` now asks the server instead — a real
      correctness fix for anyone running a smaller-context model (was silently requesting more
      context than the model has loaded), not just a bigger ceiling for larger ones. Also
      genuinely *surfaced*: `useConnectionStatus` exposes `maxContext`, shown in
      `ConnectionSettings` and the `ConnectionBadge` tooltip.
- [x] **Auto-continue a reply that got cut off by hitting `max_length`** — user-reported: replies
      sometimes ended mid-sentence instead of finishing the thought. `runGeneration`
      (`useChatSession.ts`) now loops internally (up to `MAX_AUTO_CONTINUE_ROUNDS = 2` extra
      rounds): after each generation it counts the tokens the model actually produced this round
      (`countTokens`, already existed for the token-count badge) and compares against
      `sampler.max_length` — landing at (or within one token of) the requested cap, with no abort,
      is a reliable signal the model was cut off rather than genuinely finishing on the last token.
      If so, the partial text is persisted (so an error on a later round never loses an earlier
      round's real content) and immediately continued exactly the way the existing manual
      "Continue" button already does — same `continueLastTurn` prompt shape, same
      replace-the-active-swipe write — just triggered automatically instead of waiting for the
      user to notice and click it. Post-reply assists (relationship tracking, choice suggestions,
      task detection, summarization) now fire once, after the *final* round, not once per round.
      Stopping generation by hand (the Stop button) always wins and never triggers a continue.
      Verified live: with `max_length` deliberately dropped to an extreme 40 (to force truncation
      on the very first round almost every time), a request for a long, detailed story landed a
      121-token reply — roughly 3x a single round's cap — reading as one continuous passage with
      no repeated or dropped text at the stitch points, confirming multiple rounds actually ran and
      merged correctly; at a normal `max_length` (300), this gives up to 900 tokens of headroom
      before a reply would ever visibly cut off.
      **Follow-up (user-reported, twice): a reply cut off *without* hitting `max_length`** — the
      token-count heuristic only caught the "used the whole budget" case, so a reply a stop sequence
      killed early (an over-eager end-of-turn token, a card's `mes_example` `<START>`, a stray
      persona-name line) just ended abruptly with no recovery. `runGeneration` now also auto-continues
      once when a round stopped well under the cap, wasn't aborted, wasn't band-capped, and leaves the
      text unfinished — `endsCleanly()` (`slop.ts`) is the test: it fails on no terminal punctuation
      *and* on an odd number of `*` or `"`, which is the real-world shape the user hit — a reply
      ending `*She says it like a warning.` (sentence-final period, but the closing `*` never came,
      so it rendered half-italicised). A reply that stops early *on a finished, balanced sentence* is
      a legitimate short turn and is left alone. The mid-thought recovery is capped at one extra round
      (a stop that fires twice won't be fixed by a third try, and a punctuation-poor model shouldn't
      cost three generations a reply); any tail still ragged when the loop ends is trimmed to the last
      complete sentence (as the band-cap case already was) and then `balanceTrailingMarkup()` closes a
      still-open beat or line of dialogue (or drops a bare trailing mark). 8 new `slop.test.ts`
      cases. Needs a live model to confirm the end-to-end recovery. A precise fix (surfacing the
      backend's own `finish_reason` — `"length"` vs `"stop"` — instead of inferring from token count)
      stays open: it needs a `ChatBackend` return-shape change touching every call site.
- [x] **Writing-style steering (avoid em dashes, reduce "AI slop" phrasing)** — user-requested,
      described as needing real enforcement, not just a hopeful prompt hint. Two new global
      settings (`useSettingsStore.ts`): `avoidEmDashes` (a dedicated toggle) and `styleGuidance`
      (freeform, with a "Use suggested starter" button offering a canned anti-AI-slop paragraph —
      "it's not just X, it's Y" constructions, rule-of-three lists, hedging words, purple prose —
      the user edits or replaces it freely). Both compose into one `PromptBuildInput.styleGuidance`
      string (`builder.ts`) injected in the same late, right-before-generation slot as an active
      objective or the relationship nudge, since a style instruction is followed far more reliably
      placed close to where generation actually starts than buried at the top of a long prompt.
      Belt and suspenders for the em-dash case specifically, since a model won't always fully obey
      a style instruction: toggling `avoidEmDashes` on also auto-manages one regex script (`src/lib/text/regexScripts.ts`,
      already existed for exactly this class of problem) with a stable id
      (`builtin-avoid-em-dash`, `target: 'both'`) that strips any em dash that slips through —
      toggling off removes exactly that managed rule, never a user's own. New
      `WritingStyleSection.tsx` (Settings → Generation). 2 new `builder.test.ts` cases plus one
      `regexScripts.test.ts` case pinning the managed pattern's exact behavior. Verified live:
      confirmed the toggle adds/removes the regex rule, confirmed the composed instruction lands in
      the exact assembled prompt via the Prompt Inspector, and confirmed a real generated reply
      contained zero em dashes with the toggle on.
- [x] **Vision-based scene detection** (`src/lib/vn/sceneVision.ts`) — the model self-tags every VN
      reply with a trailing `<<scene:expression=…,background=…,mood=…>>` picked *blind* from a list
      of ids; a small local model forgets it, emits an invalid id, or picks a poor match often
      enough to matter, and the reply-length cap (#104) now truncates the tag off entirely on a
      brief-band turn. With a vision-capable model loaded, a non-blocking post-reply assist
      (`refineSceneWithVision` in `useChatSession.ts`, gated behind Settings → Appearance →
      "Vision scene detection", **off by default**) corrects it by looking at the actual images:
      - **`shortlistExpressions`** — a cheap text pass that narrows a fully-spritted character's
        20+ expressions down to the ~6 that could plausibly fit the line, so the vision call only
        has to look at a handful of sprites. Always keeps the model's own tagged guess in the
        running; falls back to `[taggedGuess, …head of list]` on any unusable output.
      - **`detectExpressionFromSprites`** — shows the vision model those shortlisted sprites
        (downscaled to ~320px JPEG in `downscaleImageToBase64` — the stored files are ~1MB PNGs
        each, far more than a face classification needs and slow through the projector) and asks
        which face fits. Tolerates a JSON id, a bare id, or — since vision models love to answer
        with the picture number — a 1-based index mapped back through the attached order. An id
        match always beats an index read.
      - **`classifyAttachedImageScene`** — when the player attached a photo to their message,
        classifies it into an available background id and/or a scene mood, so the stage reflects
        what was shared. Only runs when an image is actually attached.
      Both are backups, not replacements: the `<<scene:>>` instruction stays in the prompt, and the
      pass only overrides the tag when it produces a validated answer. Every returned id is checked
      against the caller's allowed set (`sanitizeSceneTag`) before it's written back to the
      message's active swipe. Sprite→base64 conversions are memoised per hook instance.
      19 `sceneVision.test.ts` cases (370 total), typecheck + build clean. Verified live with
      Heimdallr-26B + mmproj: on a turn where a flustered Sumire reply lost its tag to the length
      cap, the vision pass filled `scene.expression = "blush"` end-to-end (shortlist → 6 downscaled
      sprites → vision → validated → persisted to `scene` + `swipeScenes`); a synthetic beach photo
      classified to `{background:"beach",mood:"calm"}`; the assist shows in the running-assists
      strip as "Reading the scene"; a genuinely fresh page load throws zero console errors.

## 9. Technical quality / security
- [x] **Playthrough-tail pass: the confirmed defects `PLAYTHROUGH_REPORT.md` left open.** The
      report's five ranked bugs were fixed as it was written; these are the ones below that line,
      each re-confirmed in the source before being touched rather than taken on the report's word.
      - **The concurrent-generation race, which the report could only flag as unconfirmed** ("might
        need unnaturally fast clicking") — it is real and needs no unusual timing. `isGenerating`
        is React state, so every entry point in `useChatSession` (`sendUserMessage`, `regenerate`,
        `swipe`, `continueMessage`, and `startDateEvent`'s scene opener) guarded on the value
        captured in its own closure, while the claim only happened via `setIsGenerating(true)`
        inside `runGeneration` — which doesn't land until the next render. Two calls in one tick
        both read `false` and both proceeded. `genKeyRef` never helped; it exists only for abort.
        `sendUserMessage` had the worst version: every `messagesApi.create` there runs before the
        first `await`, so a double send wrote two user messages *and* two placeholder replies
        before either generation began; `swipe` stranded a permanently blank swipe the same way.
        Fixed with a synchronous test-and-set lock (`src/lib/chat/generationLock.ts`), claimed by
        the **entry point** and released in a `finally` around its whole awaited body — not by
        `runGeneration`, since several callers do their own writes on the way in and those need to
        sit inside the lock rather than in front of it. `isGenerating` stays exactly as it was for
        the UI; it's now the render-visible mirror, not the guard. Extracted rather than left
        inline because this repo has no React test harness (`environment: 'node'`, every test
        targets pure `src/lib` logic) — 8 tests cover exclusion, re-claim after release, release
        on throw, that a mid-`await` holder still owns it, and the same-tick double-dispatch case
        itself.
      - **A hangout could still set `first_date`.** `assessDateOutcome` handed the classifier the
        full flag set regardless of `sceneKind`; the glossary asked it to exclude hangouts, and it
        fired on a scene explicitly started and scored as one anyway. A prose bar is a request,
        not a gate — and this app's premise is that outcomes are *judged* by the model but
        *applied* deterministically. `first_date` is now withheld from a hangout's menu and
        dropped on the way back in if returned regardless. **Writing the test caught a leak that
        would otherwise have shipped**: the prompt's own hardcoded example JSON still demonstrated
        `"newFlags":["first_date"]`, handing the flag back in the most suggestive line of the
        whole prompt — the example is now scene-kind-aware too. Built-in flags only; a world's
        `CustomSceneFlag`s have no date/hangout marker to key off, so they keep relying on their
        own `description`.
      - **`suggestDateEvent` was blind to the commitment ladder** — its params carried `affection`
        but not `commitmentStatus`, so an officially-dating couple kept being handed tentative
        "hangout" cards. Affection alone can't separate "very fond" from "actually together",
        which is the distinction that decides date vs. get-together. Optional, so a
        not-yet-official chat keeps the exact prompt it had.
      - **The lorebook overflow list rendered one blank slot per entry.** `keys[0] ?? comment` —
        `??` catches a *missing* comment, never an empty one, and the synthetic "Remembered facts"
        book (`facts.ts`) builds every entry with `keys: []` and no comment at all. New
        `describeEntry` in `activation.ts` falls through keys → comment → a collapsed content
        snippet → a placeholder, so a label is never blank. **Verified against the real database
        rather than a fixture**: the open chat's 129 remembered facts rendered 129/129 blank under
        the old logic (the line was literally a run of commas) and 0/129 under the new one.
      - **Gift line grammar** — "I give Sumire Pressed Flower Bookmark." New
        `withIndefiniteArticle` (`src/lib/text/article.ts`), deliberately biased toward *not*
        inserting an article, since gift names come from a world's own authored catalog: a missing
        "a" reads as clipped, a wrong one ("a Chocolates", "a a Cup of Tea") reads as broken. Takes
        number from the last word ("Box of Chocolates" is one box), skips existing determiners and
        counts, and handles the silent-h / "a university" cases.
      - **Intent chips had no `aria-pressed`** — armed state was carried by background color alone.
        Live-verified in the browser: all five expose `false`, only the armed one flips to `true`,
        and it clears on disarm.
      **Found while verifying, not fixed (out of this pass's scope)**: with the configured backend
      unreachable, opening the Prompt Inspector fires one `/api/extra/tokencount` request *per
      item* — 1,600+ observed on a chat with 129 facts — each failing with `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`
      before falling back to `estimateTokens`, leaving the panel stuck on "Building…" indefinitely.
      `countTokens` has no circuit breaker: one failure should be enough to estimate the rest for
      that build. Worth its own item.
- [x] **SQLite backend swapped from `better-sqlite3` to Node's built-in `node:sqlite`**
      (`server/db.ts`) — the `better-sqlite3` prebuilt native binary crashed the process outright
      (STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION) on this dev machine, reproducing even in total isolation
      (`new Database(':memory:')` outside the project). `node:sqlite`'s `DatabaseSync` has an
      almost identical API (`exec`/`prepare`/`run`/`get`/`all`) and ships inside Node itself, so
      there's no separately-downloaded `.node` binary to mismatch. Run behind
      `--experimental-sqlite` (`dev:server` script) until Node unflags it; stable since Node
      v22.5, unflagged in newer majors.
- [x] Test suite: `vitest` (pinned to `^3.2.6+`, which still supports Vite 5 — vitest 4.x requires
      Vite 6+, a much bigger, unrelated upgrade; 3.x below `3.2.6` carries a critical CVE in its
      bundled `@vitest/mocker`/vite-node, so `3.2.6+` was the only non-vulnerable option that
      doesn't force the Vite bump). `npm test` (`vitest run`) / `npm run test:watch`. 50 tests
      across `jsonRepair.test.ts`, `cardSpec.test.ts`, and `activation.test.ts` — covering the
      model-output repair heuristics, V1/V2/legacy card normalization, and lorebook keyword/
      always/manual activation plus token-budget capping. Writing the activation tests caught a
      **real bug**: manual-mode entries could never actually be activated via
      `manuallyActivatedIds` when `enabled: false`, because an earlier blanket
      `if (!entry.enabled) continue` short-circuited before the manual-mode check ever ran —
      fixed in `activation.ts` (dead code today, since nothing yet populates
      `manuallyActivatedIds`, but now matches its own documented contract).
- [x] Request timeouts added at both layers: `request()` in `client.ts` (the local API client) now
      aborts after 15s by default — bumped to 120s for `backupApi.fetchBackup`/`restore`, since a
      data-heavy backup can legitimately take longer. In `kobold.ts`, the shared `req()` helper
      used by every `KoboldClient` method now applies a 30s default timeout **only when the caller
      didn't already pass its own `AbortSignal`** — the interactive reply-generation flow always
      passes the user-controlled Stop-button signal and is untouched, while judge/choice calls in
      `relationshipAssist.ts`/`choices.ts`/`objectiveAssist.ts`/`aiAssist.ts` (which never passed a
      signal at all) are now protected without having to touch each call site individually.
- [x] Avatar/sprite upload validation: `decodeImageDataUrl()` (`server/avatars.ts`) now rejects
      (400, not a silent `.png` coercion) any mime type outside PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF, and caps every
      individual image at 8MB decoded — checked cheaply from the base64 length before allocating
      the buffer, then re-checked against the real decoded size. Applies to both single avatars
      and per-key sprite/background maps (`resolveAvatarMap` now reports which key failed).
      Wired through to the user: `CharacterEditor`/`WorldsView`/`PersonasView` save flows now
      catch and `toastError()` instead of failing silently with no feedback at all. Verified live:
      an unsupported mime type and an oversized image both come back as a clear 400 with a
      readable message; a normal save is unaffected.
- [x] Accessibility pass: every icon-only interactive element that previously relied solely on a
      `title` tooltip (or nothing at all) now has an `aria-label` — nav/sidebar buttons,
      swipe/regenerate/fork/delete message actions (`MessageBubble.tsx`, `VNStage.tsx`), the
      Composer's attach/continue/impersonate/remove-attachment buttons, the Companion mic button,
      and every avatar/sprite/CG/background `<label>` that wraps a hidden file input with no
      visible text when an image is set (`CharacterEditor`, `WorldsView`, `PersonasView`).
- [x] Minor API-surface gaps in `server/app.ts` closed: `PUT /api/themes/:id` (with an "Update"
      button per saved theme in `ThemeEditor`) and `DELETE /api/objectives/:id` (the generic
      `objectivesApi`/`themesApi` clients already called these — only the server routes were
      missing).
- [x] **Fixed a severe, previously-invisible bug: `GET /api/personas/:id` didn't exist at all** —
      found live, during a real end-to-end playthrough test. `characters`/`chats`/`worlds` all had
      their get-by-id route; personas never got one. `useChatSession`'s persona query
      (`personasApi.get(chat.personaId)`) 404'd on every single chat, silently resolving to
      `undefined` and falling back to the hardcoded `'You'` display text everywhere — including in
      the actual prompt sent to the model (`personaName`/`personaDescription` in `buildCurrentPrompt`).
      This was invisible for this entire project's development because every test persona created
      so far happened to be named "You" (the same string as the fallback), making broken and
      working output look identical. The first persona named anything else (`Kai`) exposed it
      immediately: the header showed "as You" instead of "as Kai", and the Prompt Inspector
      confirmed the model was never actually told the persona's real name or description at all.
      Added the missing route, mirroring the exact pattern already used for the other three
      resources. Verified live: header now shows the correct name, and the exact prompt now
      includes "About Kai: ..." and the relationship line using the real name.
- [x] **Fixed: a failed generation permanently baked an error string into the character's actual
      dialogue** — found live, in the same playthrough, immediately after a real koboldcpp
      disconnect. On failure, `runGeneration` persisted `text: '⚠ Generation failed. See
      notification for details.'` as the message's real content — meaning every future prompt
      would show the model a line where the character supposedly said that sentence, forever,
      unless someone manually deleted it. It also broke the Composer's own "Continue" affordance:
      since the placeholder text was non-empty, `canContinue` read as true, so the composer
      offered — and let the player click — "Continue," which would then ask the model to extend
      the *error text* as if it were legitimate dialogue, instead of the message's own "⟲
      Regenerate" (which already worked correctly, since it never trusted the current text at all).
      Fixed by keeping `text: ''` on failure and adding `StoredMessage.failed?: boolean` as a
      separate signal — `MessageBubble`/`VNStage` now render "⚠ Generation failed — try
      regenerating" purely as UI, not as stored content; `failed` is cleared back to `false` on any
      subsequent successful generation for that message. Verified live: after the fix, the
      Composer correctly fell back to a disabled "Send" instead of a misleading "Continue," and
      "⟲ Regenerate" produced a genuine, correctly in-character reply.
- [x] **Bug-hunt pass across database, character, world, and lorebook systems** — four parallel,
      read-only audits (not user-reported this time; deliberately gone looking) turned up a batch
      of real, independently-verified bugs, all fixed and live-tested against the running dev
      server + a real seeded character/world:
      - **The `JSON.stringify`-drops-`undefined` bug (first found and fixed once for
        `Chat.activeEvent`, item 28) had recurred systemically in `CharacterEditor`'s save path** —
        `voice`, `worldId`, `loveLanguage`, `customExpressions`, `giftLikes`, `giftDislikes`,
        `schedule`, and `weatherPreferences` all used the `value.length ? value : undefined`
        pattern, so *clearing* any of them (e.g. unbinding a character from a world, or wiping a
        love-language note back to empty) silently sent a request with that key missing entirely —
        the server's `'key' in req.body` patch logic correctly no-ops on an absent key, so the old
        value just stayed forever with no error. Fixed by sending `null` instead of `undefined` for
        all eight fields (`server/app.ts`'s existing per-field normalizers already treat `null` the
        same as "clear it" — confirmed, not assumed). Verified live end-to-end: cleared a real
        character's world binding via the actual editor UI, confirmed the PUT response and a fresh
        refetch both came back with `worldId` entirely absent (not just falsy) rather than the old
        bound-world id.
      - **`.rppack.json` export/import silently dropped `giftLikes`/`giftDislikes`/`loveLanguage`/
        `weatherPreferences`/`schedule`** despite the pack UI's own copy claiming full portability —
        `CharacterPackV1` and `buildCharacterPack`/`importCharacterPack` (`pack.ts`) only ever
        carried the original, smaller field set. Added all five.
      - **The World editor's "Save changes" silently reverted the live world clock** —
        `WorldEditor` seeds `currentDay`/`currentPhaseIndex` into local state once at mount and
        never refreshes it, but the general `save()` (used for *any* edit — name, lore, gifts, …)
        included that stale snapshot in every PUT. A chat spending energy/advancing a date
        elsewhere while the World editor happened to be open, followed by an unrelated "Save
        changes" click, would silently roll the clock back to whatever it was when the editor was
        opened. The dedicated "Advance to next phase" control already avoided this (sends only the
        two changed fields) — the fix was just to drop `currentDay`/`currentPhaseIndex` from the
        general save payload entirely, since nothing in that form actually edits them. Verified
        live: advanced the clock via a direct API call (simulating a live chat action) while an
        already-open editor still held the old day/phase in state, clicked "Save changes," and
        confirmed the server-side clock kept the live-advanced value instead of reverting.
      - **Deleting a persona left `Chat.personaId` dangling** — mirrors the character-delete
        cleanup that already existed for `participants`, but personas never got the equivalent scan.
        A chat whose persona was deleted 404'd on every persona fetch and silently fell back to the
        hardcoded `'You'` (same failure shape as item 41's missing persona-get route). Added the
        same full-table-scan cleanup on persona delete, clearing to `''` (personaId is a required
        `string`, not optional, so `''` rather than `null`/`undefined` stays a valid value of that
        type). Also guarded `useChatSession`'s persona query to skip the fetch entirely when
        `personaId` is falsy, instead of round-tripping a request for `/personas/` with an empty id.
      - **Deleting a chat left fork children's `parentChatId` dangling** — the header's "⑂ original
        chat" link would navigate to a chat that no longer existed. Added the same scan-and-clear
        cleanup pattern on chat delete.
      - **`POST /api/restore` wasn't atomic** — each table was wiped with `.clear()` then
        repopulated row-by-row with no surrounding transaction, so one bad row partway through
        (e.g. a backup from a slightly older schema) left some tables holding the new backup's data
        and others still holding the old, pre-restore data, with no way back since the old data was
        already gone. Now wrapped in a real `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` transaction (`node:sqlite`'s
        `DatabaseSync` executes raw transaction SQL directly). The avatar-file restore had the same
        shape of bug (wiped `avatarsDir` before rewriting it) — now writes into a temp directory
        first and only swaps it into place once every file has written successfully. Verified live:
        crafted a restore payload with a `chats` row missing its required `characterId`, confirmed
        the request came back 400 *and* every table's row count was completely unchanged afterward
        (previously, tables processed before the bad one would have stayed clobbered even though
        the overall restore failed).
      - **Re-uploading an avatar/sprite/gallery CG/background in a different image format left the
        old file behind** (`avatars.ts`) — the filename includes the extension, so a png-then-jpg
        re-upload wrote a second file rather than replacing the first, and removing an entry from a
        sprite/gallery/background map never touched disk at all. Both now prune anything no longer
        referenced right after (re)writing — a small, permanent disk-space leak on a long-lived
        local install, not data corruption.
      - **Importing a SillyTavern card silently dropped `probability`/`group`** on every lorebook
        entry (`cardSpec.ts`'s `normalizeLorebook`) — every other new activation field
        (`secondary_keys`, `selective`, `case_sensitive`, `insertion_order`) was already copied,
        these two were not, silently breaking the exact inclusion-group/probability features
        added in item 19 for any imported card that used them. Fixed, respecting ST's own
        `useProbability: false` convention for explicitly disabling a set probability.
      - **Regex lorebook keys ignored the `case_sensitive` toggle** — `/dragon/` with
        `case_sensitive: false` wouldn't match "Dragon" unless the author manually added an `i`
        flag, since the regex path never consulted the toggle at all (only the literal-match path
        did). Fixed to add an implicit `i` flag when case-insensitive and the author didn't already
        specify one explicitly.
      - **A lorebook's own `scan_depth` was completely ignored** — hardcoded to 8 messages in
        `useChatSession.ts` regardless of what an imported card's book requested (import already
        normalized a real `scan_depth`, but nothing downstream ever read it), so a card scan-tuned
        for a longer memory window in SillyTavern silently lost that behavior here. Fixed in
        `builder.ts`: the scan window now expands to the deepest `scan_depth` any active book
        requests, never narrower than the existing default.
      - **The "Manual" lorebook activation mode's docstring didn't match its actual behavior** — the
        `manuallyActivatedIds` mechanism the comment described (SillyTavern-style ad hoc per-turn
        activation) has no populating caller anywhere in the shipped app; in practice a manual entry
        is just the author's own `enabled` toggle. Not a functional bug (nothing regresses), but
        corrected the misleading comment rather than leave it implying dead machinery works.
      - Item catalog "Amount" accepted a fractional relationship-boost value in the World editor
        that the server then silently discarded back to a hardcoded `1` instead of rejecting or
        rounding it — `normalizeItemEffect` now rounds instead of defaulting.
      - Double-clicking "Advance to next phase" fired two requests off the same stale pre-`await`
        closure state (harmless — the second request just silently computed the identical "next
        phase" again — but wasteful); added a loading guard.
      - Minor: an `aria-label` on the per-expression unlock-affection number input, which previously
        had only a `title` tooltip.
      156 tests passing (2 new: regex case-sensitivity, lorebook-import probability/group
      preservation), clean typecheck, clean production build.
- [x] **Lorebook editor: UI for `selective`/`secondary_keys`, `case_sensitive`,
      `insertion_order`, and `position`** — see item 52 in "Suggested next steps" for the full
      writeup; `LorebookEditor.tsx` gained "Order"/"Position" for every entry and "Case
      sensitive"/"Also require a secondary key" for keyword-mode entries.
- [x] **10e's "Full authoring editors" — life-context fields** (partial; see section 10e's own
      note for what's still open). Eight new `Character` fields (`cardSpec.ts`): `likes`, `goals`,
      `boundaries` (free-text arrays), `socialConnections` (`SocialConnection[]` — name/relation/
      notes), `occupation`, `workplace`, `homeLocation`, `frequentedLocations`, plus one content
      flag, `dateModeOptOut`. Three new `CharacterEditor` sections follow the file's existing
      `<details>` pattern (matching Weather preferences/Schedule): "Life & background",
      "Social connections", "Content & features".
      - **Reaches the model, not just the editor** — the whole point of the earlier relationship-
        description work (item 17) was that authored data should actually change what the model
        knows, not just gate unlocks. `buildCharacterProfileNote()` (`useChatSession.ts`) composes
        a compact "Life beyond this scene: ..." line from whichever of these fields are set, folded
        into `builder.ts`'s identity block (`descriptionParts`, alongside description/personality/
        scenario) via a new `PromptBuildInput.characterProfile` field — unlike the gift-taste note
        (item 35) this is **not** gated behind `autoTrackRelationship`, since a plain-assistant or
        lore-reference use of a character should still be able to mention their job or their
        sister the same way `description` always does. Reaches the Prompt Inspector automatically
        since `previewPrompt` already goes through the same `buildCurrentPrompt` path.
      - **`dateModeOptOut` actually gates something, not just informational text** — the date/event
        toolbar button (`ChatWindow.tsx`) is hidden entirely (not just disabled) when the primary
        character has the flag set, the same "no badge at all" treatment as a character with no
        active event. Deliberately didn't force-end an already-in-progress date if the flag gets
        set mid-chat — an authorial forward-looking choice, not a retroactive purge.
      - Same clearing-bug pattern as item 51 avoided from the start this time: all eight fields use
        the `null`-not-`undefined` convention in `CharacterEditor.save()` and the matching
        `'field' in req.body` server patch logic (`server/app.ts`), plus a new
        `normalizeSocialConnections()` alongside the existing `normalizeStringArray()`.
      - `.rppack.json` export/import (`pack.ts`) carries all eight fields, same as the item-51 fix
        for the fields that predated this pass.
      - 2 new tests (`builder.test.ts`: characterProfile folds into the prompt when set, adds
        nothing when unset). Verified live end-to-end against the real seeded Sumire character:
        filled every new field through the actual editor UI (including a real social connection),
        saved, confirmed persistence via a fresh refetch, confirmed the exact "Life beyond this
        scene: ..." line in the real built prompt via the Prompt Inspector, and confirmed the
        date-event toolbar button disappeared with the flag set. **Caught a real bug in my own
        test harness along the way, not the app**: a naive `label text === "Name"` DOM query
        matched the character's own top-level Name field before the intended Social Connection's
        Name field (both share that exact label text) and briefly renamed the demo character —
        caught immediately since I was watching the response, fixed by scoping the query to the
        specific `<details>` block, demo data restored. 158 tests passing, clean typecheck, clean
        production build.
- [x] **Scene-flag authoring — custom flags beyond the fixed 4** (closes the gap noted in section
      2 and item 7). Picked over the other equally-"still open" follow-up candidate (lorebook
      sticky/cooldown) after actually sizing both first: sticky/cooldown needs a stable per-chat-
      per-entry key across lorebook sources, and this app's lorebook arrays have no such key today
      — worse, a group chat's speaker-first array ordering can reorder turn to turn, so even a
      positional-index key would be unsafe. Scene flags had a clean, already-proven path instead:
      the exact same additive shape as "custom expressions" (item 24) — the 4 built-ins keep
      working exactly as before, a world just adds its own on top, and the generic machinery reads
      whatever's actually present rather than assuming a closed set.
      - **`SceneFlag` (`types.ts`) widened from a 4-value literal union to plain `string`** — a
        genuinely zero-breakage change (confirmed by typechecking immediately after, before
        touching any call site): nothing was doing exhaustiveness-checking on it, and
        `Record<SceneFlag, string>` (the classifier's `FLAG_GLOSSARY`) stays valid with exactly 4
        keys under `Record<string, string>` too. New `CustomSceneFlag { id, label, description }`
        and `WorldCard.customSceneFlags?: CustomSceneFlag[]`.
      - **One shared source of truth**: `combinedSceneFlags(customFlags?)` (`stage.ts`) returns
        the 4 built-ins plus a world's own as `{id, label}` pairs — used by both the AI classifier
        glossary (`relationshipAssist.ts`'s `describeFlags()`/`allowedFlagIds()`, now taking an
        optional `customFlags` param on `assessRelationshipMoment`/`assessDateOutcome`) and every
        UI surface (`RelationshipPanel`'s checklist, `WorldsView`'s item "Set scene flag" picker),
        so the classifier's known-flag set and what's actually selectable in the UI can never
        drift apart the way two independently-hardcoded lists eventually would.
      - **New "Custom scene flags" `WorldsView` section** — label + description per flag (the
        description is the classifier's bar for firing, same job `FLAG_GLOSSARY`'s built-in
        entries already do), CRUD matching the existing gift/item list pattern. Removing a custom
        flag that an item's effect references falls that item back to the same default a
        freshly-created flag effect gets, rather than leaving a dangling reference an item could
        never actually fire (the same "don't silently corrupt a record via an orphaned reference"
        bar as section 9's other fixes).
      - **Server-side validation actually extended, not just the UI** — `normalizeItemEffect`
        previously validated a "set flag" effect against a fixed 4-value `Set`; an item
        referencing a would-be-valid custom flag would have silently fallen through to a
        completely different effect kind (a relationship nudge) with no error, the exact silent-
        corruption bug class fixed elsewhere this session. Now takes an `allowedFlags` set built
        from the built-in 4 plus whichever custom flags are in effect after the *same* request
        (handles a world's custom flags and its items being saved together in one PUT).
      - `.rppack.json` world bundle gained `customSceneFlags` — and, spotted as a genuinely
        pre-existing adjacent gap while touching this exact file, `items` too (the world pack
        never carried the item catalog at all before this).
      - 3 new tests (`stage.test.ts`: default-only, default+custom, no accidental label mangling).
        Verified live end-to-end against the real seeded world: added a custom flag ("Study date
        confessed") through the actual `WorldsView` UI, confirmed it appears in an item's flag
        picker and the `RelationshipPanel` checklist with its own label, set a real item to use it
        and confirmed the server accepted (not silently substituted) the custom id, then restored
        the world to its exact original seed state. 161 tests passing, clean typecheck, clean
        production build.
- [x] **Per-turn assist-call orchestration + a visible "thinking" state** — the (b) part is done:
      the post-reply assists (relationship scoring, choice suggestion, objective check, memory
      summary) are now routed through a `runAssist(key, label, fn)` helper in `useChatSession.ts`
      that tracks which are in flight, exposed as `assistActivity: string[]` and rendered as a
      thin pulsing strip above the composer (`AssistActivityBar.tsx`, both chat and VN mode) — so
      a relationship delta or a new choice card appearing a few seconds after the reply reads as
      expected work rather than a glitch. They also now fire player-facing-first (relationship +
      choices before tasks + summary), so the results a user waits on queue ahead on the server.
      The four Settings → Generation toggle descriptions were rewritten to be honest about the
      cost (each is a model call; on a local single-GPU server they queue with each other and
      ahead of the next reply) instead of the old "never blocks or delays it". (c) the one-switch
      "minimal assists" profile shipped as #128: two derived-state `Chip` buttons ("All assists on" /
      "Minimal (all off)") in a new "Background AI assists" section atop Settings → Generation
      batch-set the same four toggles through their existing setters — no fifth persisted "profile"
      field to drift out of sync with the four real booleans, the individual toggles still work fine
      on their own either way. (a) shipped as #129, closing this bullet out in full: when
      relationship-tracking and task-detection are both due the same turn (not suppressed by a live
      date), `assessRelationshipMoment` now takes an optional `pendingTasks` list and returns
      `completedTaskIndices` alongside its usual deltas/flags/facts — the same "fold it into the one
      call already running" idea item 18 used for scene flags and fact extraction — instead of
      `detectAndMarkTasks` firing its own separate, serialized request. Either toggle alone, or a
      live date, still takes the exact original standalone path; an inactive/empty objective makes
      the merged call behave identically to a plain relationship check (no wasted prompt tokens, no
      spurious completions).
- [x] **`manuallyActivatedIds` is still dead machinery** — deleted rather than wired up. Sized both
      options first, per this item's own framing: a real per-entry "force on for next reply"
      control needs a stable key to force *one specific* entry on, but `LorebookEntry.id` is only
      unique within its own book and `activateWorldInfo()` scans every active book (character +
      world + bound standalone books) in one call — so the shipped shape of this branch was worse
      than just unused, it was latently unsafe: activating id `3` for one intended entry could just
      as easily light up an unrelated same-numbered entry in a completely different book. This is
      the identical cross-source id-collision problem item 54's scene-flag-authoring writeup
      already flagged for a near-identical sticky/cooldown idea, which is why that one also went
      unbuilt rather than risk it. Removed the parameter from `activateWorldInfo()`
      (`activation.ts`) and `PromptBuildInput.manuallyActivatedWorldInfoIds` (`builder.ts`) entirely
      rather than leave a footgun sitting there for whoever eventually builds the real (composite-
      key) version of this control. Manual-mode entries' actual, live behavior — fires purely off
      their own `enabled` toggle — is untouched; only the always-empty additive branch is gone.
      Updated `activation.test.ts` (one dead test replaced with a real "excludes when disabled"
      case, two affection-gating tests' now-shifted positional argument fixed); all 240 tests still
      green, typecheck and build clean.
- [x] **WAL checkpoint on clean shutdown** — `server/index.ts` now traps `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` and
      runs `checkpointDb()` (`PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`, `server/db.ts`) before exiting, so
      a normal Ctrl+C folds `rp.db-wal` back into `rp.db` and the main database file is complete on
      its own. Purely a convenience for anyone copying `rp.db` by hand — WAL-mode writes were
      already durable on disk. Part of the on-disk persistence audit (changelog #58); the full
      data layout is now documented in the README.
- [~] **Full-codebase audit pass (koboldcpp offline, so read-only — code review, not live
      verification)**: every `src/lib` and `server` file read end to end against the README's own
      threat model ("local-only, no auth, must never be reachable off this machine"), plus
      `npm audit` and a scan for the usual danger patterns (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `eval`,
      `child_process`, unvalidated file paths). The good news first: no XSS sink anywhere in the
      client, no shell/`eval` execution anywhere, avatar/sprite/background file handling
      (`server/avatars.ts`) already rejects path traversal via a strict UUID/key allowlist *and*
      caps upload size *and* prunes stale files, backup restore (`POST /api/restore`) is already
      transactional (one SQL `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`) and writes into a temp directory before
      atomically swapping it in so a failed restore can't half-destroy the old data, and there is
      not one `@ts-ignore`, `TODO`, or `as any` escape hatch anywhere in either `src` or `server`.
      What the pass actually found:
      - ~~**No explicit origin check on the Express API**~~ — `server/app.ts` had no CORS/Origin
        allowlist at all. In practice this mostly self-protected already, since the browser requires
        a preflight (which gets no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` back, so it's blocked) for `DELETE`/
        `PUT` and for any `POST` sent with `Content-Type: application/json` — but a "simple" POST
        (`text/plain`, no custom headers) from *any other site or tab open in the same browser*
        still reached action-only endpoints with no body needed, blind. `POST /api/chats/:id/restore`
        (shipped below) is exactly that shape: no body, real side effect. Fixed as part of #119 —
        see that entry for the full write-up.
      - ~~**ReDoS via user-authored/imported regex, unbounded**~~ — both World Info's regex-key
        syntax (`parseRegexKey` in `activation.ts`, `/pattern/flags` keys) and Settings → Generation's
        Regex Scripts (`regexScripts.ts`) compile arbitrary regex from the lorebook/character
        card/preset and run `.test()`/`.replace()` against the full conversation text on every
        single turn, with no complexity check, no length cap on the input, and no execution budget.
        A pathological pattern (classic catastrophic-backtracking shapes like `(a+)+$`) in an
        imported card or lorebook — the SillyTavern ecosystem is built on downloading cards shared
        by strangers — would hang the tab, not just that one turn. Fixed as part of #119 with the two
        mitigations this finding itself named as realistic (a haystack cap + an authoring-time
        complexity linter) — see that entry.
      - [x] **Known moderate/high vulnerability in the pinned dev toolchain — fixed (#116)** —
        `npm audit` flagged the `esbuild`/Vite pair then pinned (`vite@^5.4.10`):
        [GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99), "esbuild enables
        any website to send any requests to the development server and read the response." Dev-only
        (`npm run dev`), not the production build, but this app's own README recommends `npm run
        dev` as the *only* way to run it day to day, so it wasn't a theoretical-only exposure.
        `npm audit fix --force`'s own suggestion (`vite@8.x`) overstated the fix needed — it
        defaults to the latest major regardless of where the actual fix landed. Checked the real
        dependency chain directly (`npm view`) instead of trusting that: the vulnerable esbuild
        range is `<=0.24.2`, the patch is `0.25.0`, and **Vite 6.2.0 was the first version to bundle
        it** — Vite 6.0–6.1 still ship the vulnerable `esbuild@^0.24.2`, so "just Vite 6" wasn't
        quite enough either, it had to be 6.2+. `@vitejs/plugin-react@4.3.3` (then pinned) only
        supports Vite up to `^5.0.0`; `4.7.0` adds `^6.0.0`/`^7.0.0` without jumping to the newer
        Rolldown/oxc-based `5.x` line tied to Vite 8. `vitest@^3.2.7` already declared support for
        Vite `^5 || ^6 || ^7` with no changes needed. Bumped to `vite@^6.4.3` +
        `@vitejs/plugin-react@^4.7.0` — no `vite.config.ts` changes needed, the config only uses
        options that carried over unchanged. Verified: `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities;
        typecheck, all 442 tests, and a production build all pass clean; dev server boots
        (`VITE v6.4.3`) with a correct `Re-optimizing dependencies because lockfile has changed`
        one-time notice; live-verified the app actually loads and the `/api` proxy to the Express
        backend still resolves correctly (`GET /api/chats/trash` / `GET /api/characters` both
        200, confirmed via the browser's own network log).
      - **Minor: static avatar files carry no access control beyond UUID obscurity** — `/avatars`
        is a plain `express.static` mount with no origin check; any page open in the same browser
        that discovers (not just guesses — UUIDs are fine against guessing) an avatar URL can
        hotlink it. Very low practical severity, noted for completeness rather than urgency.
        **Deliberately left open, not missed**: the app's own threat model is "local-only, no auth"
        (see the README) — real access control here would mean adding session auth or signed URLs,
        a materially bigger architectural change than this finding's severity justifies, not a gap
        the Origin-allowlist fix (#119) happens to close (an `<img>` tag never sends an `Origin`
        header at all, so it wouldn't be affected either way).
      - **Minor: TTS provider API keys sit in the persisted settings store in plain text**
        (`localStorage`, via `useSettingsStore`) — normal for a local-only app with no server-side
        secret store to put them in instead, and there's no XSS sink to chain it through today, but
        worth remembering if that ever changes. **Deliberately left open**: a real fix needs an OS
        keychain integration, a genuinely separate, larger effort this finding's own severity
        doesn't call for yet.
      - ~~**Accessibility: the shared `<Modal>`... has no focus trap, no initial-focus management,
        and no ARIA dialog semantics**~~ — fixed as part of #119.
      - ~~**Small UX gap, not a bug**: no way to pin/favorite a whole *chat*~~ — fixed as part of
        #119.
      **The read-only audit pass itself deliberately implemented nothing** — koboldcpp being offline
      also ruled out live-verifying anything model-dependent even if it had. Each finding was sized
      to be its own follow-up; the dev-toolchain CVE (#116) was the first one picked up, right after
      the pass. #119 closes out every remaining *actionable* finding — see that entry — leaving only
      the two "minor, deliberately left open" ones above, both blocked on a genuinely separate,
      larger architectural change rather than anything this pass could reasonably fold in.
- [x] **Closes out section 9: origin allowlist, ReDoS hardening, `<Modal>` accessibility, chat
      pinning** (#119) — the four actionable findings the audit pass above left open, all picked up
      in one pass since none of them touch the others.
      - **Origin/Referer allowlist** (`server/app.ts`) — this API has no auth to fall back on (the
        README's own threat model: local-only, must never be reachable off this machine), so Origin
        is the only signal available. A browser can never lie about its own Origin header, so a real
        cross-site request can't spoof its way past this the way it could spoof a body field — only
        a *present-but-mismatched* Origin (or, failing that, Referer) is rejected; both absent
        entirely (some same-origin request shapes, and non-browser tools like curl or this project's
        own live-verification passes) stay allowed, since neither can be a cross-site browser attack.
        `PORT` mirrors the exact env var `vite.config.ts` already reads for the client's own dev port,
        so a customized port only needs setting once. **Verified against the real server, not just
        the client** (a browser can't forge its own Origin header, so this needed `curl` directly
        against port 3001, bypassing the Vite proxy): a matching Origin and no Origin at all both
        return 200 on both a read and a mutating `POST`; a mismatched Origin returns 403 on both.
      - **ReDoS hardening** (`src/lib/text/regexSafety.ts`, new) — both mitigations the audit finding
        itself named as realistic, applied to both surfaces the finding named:
        - `MAX_REGEX_HAYSTACK_LENGTH` (50,000 chars) caps what a World Info regex *key* is ever
          tested against (`activation.ts`) — only the regex path, never the plain `.includes()`
          keyword path, which can't catastrophically backtrack regardless of length and would only
          lose real matches if truncated. Regex Scripts deliberately did *not* get the same
          haystack cap — they `.replace()` the actual message text rather than just testing it, so
          truncating would silently corrupt real content; the linter below is that surface's
          mitigation instead.
        - `isRiskyRegexPattern()` — a shallow, fast heuristic for the textbook "nested quantifier"
          shape (`(a+)+`, `(a*)+`, ...) the audit's own example used, deliberately not a real static
          analyzer (general regex-complexity analysis is undecidable). Flags, never blocks — some
          legitimate patterns look like this too, exactly per the finding's own "flag it, don't
          silently block it" guidance. Wired into both authoring surfaces: `RegexScriptsSection.tsx`
          (the find pattern) and `LorebookEditor.tsx` (both primary and secondary regex keys, which
          share the exact same `test()` closure in `matchesKeywords` and so are equally exposed).
        12 new tests (`regexSafety.test.ts`) covering the heuristic, the key-pattern extractor, and
        the haystack cap's non-effect on ordinary-length input. Verified live: added a script with
        `(a+)+$` through the real Settings UI and confirmed the amber (not red — this isn't an
        error) warning renders with the correct computed color, matching `--c-warning`.
      - **`<Modal>` accessibility** (new `src/lib/hooks/useFocusTrap.ts`, shared by every panel built
        on `<Modal>` — a dozen-plus of them) — ported `<ConfirmDialog>`'s already-correct pattern
        (`role`, `aria-modal`, `aria-label`, backdrop-click-to-close) onto the shared shell, plus a
        real keyboard focus trap `<ConfirmDialog>` itself didn't actually have: Tab/Shift+Tab now
        cycle only among the dialog's own focusable elements rather than escaping into the page
        behind it, initial focus lands on the first focusable element (or the dialog container
        itself if there isn't one) instead of nowhere in particular, and closing restores focus to
        whatever opened it. Deliberately a manual Tab-cycling trap rather than migrating to the
        native `<dialog>` element, which would need every existing modal's positioning/backdrop
        styling reset — a much larger, riskier change than this finding asked for.
        **Verified live against the real DOM**, not just code review: opened the Relationship panel
        and confirmed `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal="true"`/`aria-label="Relationship"` and that focus
        landed on its first focusable element; pressed Shift+Tab from there and confirmed it wrapped
        to the *last* of the panel's 13 focusable elements (not out into the page); pressed Tab once
        more and confirmed it wrapped back to the first; clicked the backdrop and confirmed the
        dialog closed *and* focus returned to the toolbar button that opened it.
      - **Chat pin/favorite** (`Chat.pinned`, `ChatsPanel.tsx`) — the chat-level analog of
        `StoredMessage.pinned`. A pinned chat sorts to the top of the list (a stable sort, so the
        rest keeps its existing `updatedAt` order) and shows a filled star next to its title at
        rest, not hover-only — same "otherwise there'd be no way to spot it while scrolling"
        reasoning message-pinning already established. "Pin to top"/"Unpin" added to the row's
        existing "•••" menu, next to Rename/Duplicate/Delete. Verified live: pinned the seeded
        Sumire chat through the real menu, confirmed `pinned: true` server-side and the star
        rendering with the theme's actual `--c-accent` color, then unpinned and confirmed both
        cleared.
      12 new tests total (`regexSafety.test.ts`; the Modal/pin changes are UI-only, covered by live
      verification rather than unit tests, matching how this codebase already treats other
      component-level fixes). Typecheck + full suite (463 tests at the time) + production build all
      clean.

## 10. Major expansion: a living-world dating sim

Everything above treats a "chat" as the unit of play: one character, one open-ended
conversation, one scalar `affection` number. The app already spans a spectrum of use — plain
assistant chat, freeform roleplay with a character, and (thinner today) a dating-sim world
simulation, plus characters used more as world/lore reference than a person to talk to — and the
ask here is to make that whole spectrum genuinely customizable, with characters that behave like
people who have schedules and inner lives rather than a chat window that only speaks when spoken
to. This is a multi-phase, multi-month effort, not a single item — see the phase order at the end
of this section. It directly supersedes the existing gap note in section 2 ("No stat beyond a
single scalar `affection`...").

**Two design principles worth stating up front, since they should hold across every subsection
below:**
- **The model plays the character; deterministic code runs the world.** Time, the calendar,
  money, inventory, unlocks, schedules, relationship arithmetic, flags, and weather should all be
  plain code with no model call in the loop — the model's job is dialogue, tone, and interpreting
  what happened, not deciding game state. This is already the shape of `assessAffectionDelta`/
  `detectSceneFlags` in `relationshipAssist.ts` (a judge pass produces a small, validated delta;
  code applies it) — 10b through 10f all lean on that same pattern rather than ever asking the
  model to just declare "the player gained 7 affection."
- **`Character`, not `Chat`, becomes the anchor for anything that outlives one conversation.**
  Schedules, moods, episodic memory, and relationship state in 10c/10f describe a character
  independent of any particular chat window. `Chat` stays the primary thing a user opens, but the
  data these subsections add belongs on (or keyed by) the character, not duplicated per chat —
  worth keeping in mind when these land in `types.ts`, so it doesn't get bolted onto `Chat` by
  default the way `affection` was.

### 10a. World simulation & time
- [x] **Calendar**: a repeating 112-day year — 4 seasons × 28 days, each season starting on a
      Monday — with a day-of-week and morning/afternoon/evening/night phases. Four fixed annual
      holidays, one per season at its midpoint (day 14/28): First Bloom (Spring), Midsummer Night
      (Summer), the Lantern Festival (Autumn), and the Long Night (Winter). Pure deterministic
      functions in `src/lib/world/calendar.ts` (`getCalendarInfo`), 17 vitest cases covering
      season/weekday wraparound and holiday placement. **Resolves the anchoring question 10's own
      intro raises** (does clock/mood state belong on `Character`, `Chat`, or something else): the
      clock is `World`-level shared state (`WorldCard.currentDay`/`currentPhaseIndex` — two plain
      integers, one clock per world, shared by every chat and character in it, advanced manually
      for now via a "World clock" control in `WorldsView`), while weather/mood-of-day are never
      stored at all — deterministically recomputed from `(worldId or characterId, day)`, so
      browsing the forecast ahead of time is just calling the function with a larger day number.
      A day only advances manually today (see the still-open energy-economy bullet below).
- [x] **Energy/action economy (core ledger + the one real consumer today)** — done: a small daily
      action pool, 3 on a weekday / 4 on a weekend (the extra one for staying out late), derived
      entirely from `WorldCard.currentDay`/`currentPhaseIndex` — no new persisted field, matching
      this file's own "nothing needs its own storage beyond the two integers that actually change"
      philosophy. New pure functions in `calendar.ts`: `getMaxEnergyForDay`, `getEnergyRemaining`,
      and `spendEnergy` (steps the phase clock and, if that used up the day's last action, rolls
      straight on to next morning — "Sleep" — rather than stranding the world at a phase with
      nothing left to do; a weekend's bonus action already lands exactly on `advancePhase`'s own
      night-to-next-morning wraparound, so only a weekday's earlier cutoff, 3 actions but 4 phases,
      ever needs that extra forced step, which is also why a weekday quietly "ends" at night while
      a weekend lets the player still be awake to spend one there). Starting a `kind: 'date'` event
      now spends one action through this and is blocked outright (disabled button, explicit
      message) once the day's actions run out; gift/milestone cards are untouched, since they
      aren't a "spend a chunk of the day" activity the way a date is. `WorldsView`'s World clock
      section now shows remaining actions alongside the day/weather; its manual "Advance" control
      stays an explicit authoring/testing step, unrelated to the energy spend. Deliberately
      narrower than the full item: the manual "Advance" button was the only pre-existing consumer
      of `advancePhase`, and today a date is the only *other* real in-chat action that exists —
      hangouts, work shifts, "Together," and minigames all stay open below (10b, 10d), each will
      wire into the same `spendEnergy` once it exists. The written day-recap and "what happened
      around town" narration also stay open — the latter needs the NPC-background-simulation
      groundwork from section 12 (explicitly "not scheduled"), so Sleep today is a short
      deterministic toast (new weather), not an AI-narrated recap. Texts gating on phase is moot
      until proactive outreach (10f) exists. 10 new unit tests (`calendar.test.ts`) cover both the
      weekday-forces-a-rollover and weekend-natural-rollover cases explicitly, plus the boundary
      floor at 0. Verified live: energy display, the blocked/disabled state at 0 actions, the
      rollover toast and world-state change on spend, and that a gift-kind event is correctly
      unaffected by 0 energy — all through direct API state, since exercising `startDateEvent` for
      real needs a live model (koboldcpp is off in dev) only for the "Suggest event with AI" step,
      not for starting an already-drafted card.
- [x] **Economy (first earning hook)** — done, a first slice rather than the full item. A date's
      outcome now earns real coins scaled to how it actually went (`Math.max(0, deltas.affection *
      2)`, added to the same `chatsApi.update` call `endDateEvent` already makes) — a date that
      lands earns money, a flat or hurtful one earns none, which is the "earned, not handed out"
      framing this bullet asks for. Deliberately not the literal work-shift/minigame/wealth-holding
      mechanics named in the original bullet — none of those exist as real actions yet, so wiring
      into the one real action that does (a scored date) is the honest substitution, the same kind
      of scoping-down used elsewhere in this file. Also deliberately NOT done: migrating
      `Chat.giftCoins` to a shared per-world/player wallet — coins earned from a date still land on
      that one chat's own balance, same as every other coin flow today (`buyGift`, the existing
      per-turn trickle in `updateAffectionFromReply`, `NewChatDialog`'s flat starting 24) — that
      migration is a real, separate architectural change this slice doesn't attempt. Verified the
      mechanism live: since the earning path itself needs a live model judge call to exercise for
      real, the coin-award formula was reviewed directly and the surrounding `chatsApi.update`/
      toast plumbing is identical to already-proven, already-shipped patterns in the same function.
- [x] **Deterministic weather**: every world-day has forecastable weather (`getWeather(worldId,
      day)`, `calendar.ts`), seeded so it's reproducible rather than random-per-request — the same
      day always reads the same, and tomorrow's forecast is just `getWeather(worldId, day + 1)`.
      Each character has a mood-of-day (`getMoodOfDay`) plus an authored weather love/hate
      (`Character.weatherPreferences`, editable in `CharacterEditor`'s "Weather preferences"
      section) — both feed `describeWorldMoment()`, one deterministic line merged into
      `worldDescription` (`useChatSession.ts`'s `buildCurrentPrompt`) every turn, nudging tone
      without ever stating a number or dictating the scene. No standalone "Weather" browsing panel
      yet — only the current day's forecast is surfaced in the World editor today.

### 10b. Live date & hangout conversations
- [x] **A genuinely live, turn-by-turn date mode**: pick a character and a place, then hold a
      real streamed conversation, one message at a time, with the model staying fully in
      character (no chatbot tics, no "happy to help") and breaking the ice itself on a real first
      date instead of leaving the player to message a stranger. This is a different shape from
      today's `DateEventCard`/`DateEventPanel`/`Objective` flow, which drafts a scene card and
      tracks it as a checklist — it doesn't run a scored, live scene. A date is naturally a
      one-character instance of the `Scene` concept proposed for group chats in section 4 — worth
      building on the same machinery rather than two parallel "live conversation" systems.
      **Resolved as #117 within the existing `DateEventCard`/`isLiveScene` machinery** (#102/#112/
      #113 already made a date/hangout a real live-scored scene; what stayed missing was
      specifically the "breaking the ice" half) **rather than the full `Scene` entity** the original
      wording gestured at — that entity (location/objective as first-class state, turn policies
      beyond fully manual) stays exactly where section 4/12 already left it: deferred until manual
      group chats see more real use. Building a second parallel system just for dates would have
      pre-empted that decision rather than waited for it. See #117 for the actual writeup, and its
      pairing with the "reactive portrait" bullet below (also closed by #117).
- [x] **Intent chips** (#108) — `src/lib/dating/intent.ts`: a `MessageIntent`
      (`flirt`/`tease`/`open_up`/`reassure`/`apologize`) the player can arm; it rides with the next
      message (`StoredMessage.intent`, carried on fork + backup for free as a row field) then
      disarms. `IntentChips` shows the base three always and the two friction-repair ones only once
      `tension >= 12`. It never moves a stat directly — each spec carries a `judgeLine` fed into
      `assessRelationshipMoment` (per turn) and `assessDateOutcome` (the list across a date),
      phrased so a well-read, well-timed beat helps and a misjudged one costs ("do not just reward
      the attempt"). The tag shows on the message bubble at rest in all three chat styles. Gated on
      the same "relationship tracking active for this chat" condition as the judge itself. 9 new
      tests (399 total). Verified live on Gemma: arming Tease and poking Sumire about her own
      subject got a real backfire — she snapped about theological density and "stop calling me
      that, I'm not a professor" — with the judge moving tension, not just a token positive bump.
      **UI (#109):** first shipped as its own bar above the composer, which read as misplaced;
      moved *inside* the composer card as its `intentSlot` — a quiet row above the textarea, split
      off by a hairline, armed chip in accent — so it reads as part of writing the line. Same pass:
      `GenerationHud`/`AssistActivityBar` aligned to `max-w-chat` like everything else in that
      strip; `ChoiceList`/`QuickReplyBar` pills lost their borders+shadows for a plain bg-step +
      hover (design brief: reserve hard borders); VN mode's swipe/regen/fork/pin controls now
      recede to 30% opacity at rest and return on hover, so a settled scene reads as the art and
      the dialogue rather than a control strip.
- [x] **Live rapport indicator** (#110) — `src/lib/dating/rapport.ts`: while a live date runs, a
      cheap stateless judge (`assessRapport`, ~90 tokens) reads the last few turns and returns one
      of five trajectory labels (`lighting_up` / `warming` / `at_ease` / `pulling_back` /
      `on_edge`) plus a short in-world note. It **never** touches affection or the dimensions — it's
      the qualitative counterpart to end-of-date scoring, so the player can feel the scene trending
      without a number moving or the outcome being spoiled. Stored on `Chat.rapport`
      (`{trajectory, note, updatedAt}`), refreshed each turn only during a live date, cleared when
      the date starts and ends, stripped on fork. `LiveRapport` shows it as a trend-coloured dot +
      phrase — in the default header it *replaces* the frozen warmth bar/number (which can't move
      during a date), in the VN Bond HUD it's a new line; the judge's note is the tooltip. Also
      ties into #108: while rapport reads `pulling_back`/`on_edge`, the Reassure/Apologize intent
      chips surface even though the tension *stat* is frozen. 8 new tests (407 total). Verified
      live on Gemma across a full arc: a warm opener read `warming` ("her lecture is losing its
      bite"); a phone-checking brush-off dropped it to `on_edge` ("the mask has slipped") and
      surfaced the repair chips; a tagged sincere apology + real interest recovered it to `warming`
      ("she is letting him stay") — with `affection` sitting at 0 throughout.
      ~~**Still open here:** the "reactive portrait" half~~ — in VN mode the sprite already shifts
      per reply via scene tags / §8 vision, so it's partly covered; a portrait in the *default*
      (non-VN) layout during a date was not built. Closed by #117.
- [x] **Bugfix: `**bold**`/`<i>` action text rendered wrong (worst in VN)** (#111) — user report:
      the model (and the player, typing) drift between `*action*`, `**action**`, and `<i>action</i>`
      for the identical thing, and the app only ever handled the first. `**x**` partially matched
      the old single-asterisk segment regex, leaving stray `*` characters either side of an italic
      run; `<i>`/`<b>` displayed as raw literal tags. Worst in VN mode specifically because its
      inline "last user message" bubble skipped `renderMessageText` entirely and printed
      `message.text` raw. Fix: `normalizeRpMarkup()` (`messageSegments.ts`, folding in #106's
      `stripHtmlFormatting`) is now the one shared normaliser — HTML pairs and any `**`/`***` run
      collapse to a single `*action*` — called from three places so store, prompt-history, and
      display can never disagree: `cleanModelOutput` (the model's own text), `sendUserMessage` (the
      player's typed line, not the file contents `composeMessageText` appends), and
      `splitMessageSegments` itself (a render-time safety net for old messages and the mid-stream
      preview, which the first two never touch). `SEGMENT_RE` also widened to `\*{1,3}` so a
      not-yet-normalised `**`/`***` run still renders correctly rather than needing the pre-pass to
      be perfect. Fixed the VN user-bubble bypass to route through `renderMessageText` like every
      other message surface. 13 new tests (413 total). Verified live: a message typed with
      `**bold**` and `<i>italic</i>` mixed renders as clean italic action text with no stray
      asterisks or literal tags, in both chat styles and VN mode; the stored/prompt-history copy is
      the normalised `*single-asterisk*` form in all cases.
- [x] **Real stakes: hidden agendas + walkouts** (#112) — closes out 10b's remaining open item.
      - **Hidden agenda** — `draftHiddenAgenda` (`relationshipAssist.ts`) runs once in `startDateEvent`,
        drafting what the character secretly wants/needs/fears from the scene straight from their
        own card (personality, goals, boundaries) + current warmth. Freeform one sentence, not
        JSON — nothing to validate beyond length, so a model that ignores the format still produces
        something usable. Stored on `DateEventCard.hiddenAgenda`, **never surfaced anywhere in the
        UI**, only read back by `assessDateOutcome` at the end so the recap/deltas reflect whether
        it was actually met, ignored, or worked against — without ever naming "agenda" in the
        in-world recap. Best-effort: a thin card or a failed call just leaves it unset, never blocks
        starting the date.
      - **Walkouts** — extends the rapport judge that already runs every live-date turn
        (`RapportRead.walkOut`) rather than adding a second call: `true` only for a genuine
        dealbreaker *this turn* (overt hostility/cruelty, an explicit/crude proposition), explicitly
        instructed to be rare so ordinary friction or a bad joke never trips it. When it fires,
        `runGeneration` calls `endDateEvent({ walkedOut: true })` immediately — the date ends for
        real, not a quiet score-only consequence the player finds later. `assessDateOutcome` takes a
        `walkedOut` flag that forces genuinely negative deltas and an in-world "abrupt exit" recap
        instead of a neutral summary; the closing toast reads as an error (red), not the usual
        success tone.
      13 new tests (419 total). **Live-verified in three separate steps** (koboldcpp real-model
      calls, not mocked): (1) starting a date drafted a genuinely specific, in-character agenda for
      Sumire tied to her architecture obsession and tsundere avoidance of gratitude; (2) the rapport
      judge's `walkOut` field reads correctly across escalating live turns — conservative but real:
      ordinary rudeness/crudeness reads as `on_edge`/`pulling_back` with `walkOut:false`, while
      genuinely extreme content (explicit degrading propositions, wishing harm on someone's family)
      reliably triggers `walkOut:true` in isolated repeated calls, confirmed with real sampling
      variance (not deterministic at temperature 0.3 — expected for a borderline judgment call, not
      a bug); (3) `assessDateOutcome`'s `walkedOut` framing, tested directly, produced maximum
      negative deltas across every dimension and an appropriately severe in-world recap ("nothing
      short of abusive... fleeing in terror"), not a neutral ending summary. Caught and fixed one
      real bug during this: `draftHiddenAgenda`'s prompt had no trailing generation cue (every other
      judge in this file ends on a bare cue line like `JSON:`) — without one the model reliably
      produced nothing at all; added a `Sentence:` cue to match the established pattern.
      **Known tuning knob:** the walkout bar is deliberately conservative (mildly crude/rude lines
      correctly do NOT trigger it) — loosen the `walkOut` judge instruction in `rapport.ts` if real
      play shows it should catch more.
- [x] **Save-safe end-of-date scoring** — done. Starting a `kind: 'date'` event card (via
      `startDateEvent`) now stamps `DateEventCard.startedAt`, marking it a live, scored date rather
      than the original lightweight event-card flow; the per-turn `updateAffectionFromReply` judge
      call is suppressed for the whole chat while such a date is active (`inLiveDate` guard in
      `useChatSession.ts`'s `runGeneration`), so nothing moves turn by turn during the date itself.
      A new `endDateEvent()` gathers every message since `startedAt`, and — if the transcript is
      non-empty — runs one whole-scene judge pass (`assessDateOutcome` in `relationshipAssist.ts`,
      mirroring the existing single-call-delta pattern) that returns clamped -5..5 deltas per
      dimension, new scene flags, new durable facts, and a short recap, applied atomically once the
      date ends. Starting a date and never sending a message closes it quietly with no judge call
      and no movement at all — deliberately not counting a date nobody actually had.
      `DateEventPanel` shows a distinct "Live date in progress" panel (title/description/an
      explanatory line that scoring happens once, honestly, at the end) with a single "End date"
      action while a live date is active, replacing the normal suggest/start UI for that chat.
      A genuine bug surfaced during live verification and is fixed here too: clearing an optional
      field through the generic `PUT /api/chats/:id` merge (`{ activeEvent: undefined }`) silently
      did nothing, because `JSON.stringify` drops `undefined`-valued keys entirely before the
      request body is ever sent — the server never saw the field, let alone cleared it. Both
      clearing call sites (`endDateEvent`'s `closeOutEvent`, and the pre-existing
      `setObjectiveStatus`, which had the same latent bug) now send `activeEvent: null` instead,
      which `JSON.stringify` preserves; every read site already used `?.`/truthy checks, so `null`
      reads identically to `undefined` everywhere. Verified live end-to-end via direct API calls
      (koboldcpp is off in dev): empty-transcript end correctly clears `activeEvent` and the header
      button/panel revert to normal; non-empty-transcript end correctly attempts the judge call,
      fails gracefully with a toast when the model is unreachable, and — importantly — leaves the
      date live rather than half-clearing it, so the player can retry once the model is back.
      Deliberately deferred, still open below: intent chips, a live rapport indicator/reactive
      portrait, hidden per-date agendas and walkouts, and hangouts as a distinct non-scored mode —
      none of those exist yet, only the scoring mechanism itself.
- [x] **Hangouts** (#113) — closes out 10b. The same live-scene apparatus as a date
      (`DateEventCard.kind: 'hangout'`) with the stakes switched off: no hidden agenda drafted, no
      walkout risk, gentler end-of-scene framing — on the premise that people fall for each other
      over ordinary time together too, not only on defined "dates." One new `isLiveScene(event)`
      predicate (`src/lib/dating/stage.ts`) replaces four scattered
      `kind === 'date' && startedAt`-only checks (`useChatSession.ts`'s `inLiveDate`,
      `ChatWindow.tsx`/`VNStage.tsx`'s `liveDateActive`, `DateEventPanel.tsx`'s `isLiveDate`) so a
      hangout's live-ness can never drift out of sync between them.
      - **Same machinery, gated stakes**: `startDateEvent`'s energy-spend gate now covers both
        kinds (a hangout is still "spend a chunk of the day" the way a date is); `draftHiddenAgenda`
        stays date-only (a hangout never gets one); the rapport judge is still asked for `walkOut`
        every turn during a hangout (one call, same as a date — not worth a second prompt variant)
        but `runGeneration` only acts on it for `kind === 'date'`, so a hangout can never end itself.
      - **Gentler judge framing**: `assessDateOutcome` takes a new `sceneKind?: 'date' | 'hangout'`
        — for a hangout the prompt swaps in "hangout" throughout, adds an explicit low-stakes/no-
        verdict instruction, and tells the judge a flat or awkward hangout can score near zero but
        essentially never negative, versus a date's "score it honestly, negative if it earned it."
      - **Suggestions offer both**: `suggestDateEvent`'s prompt now explains the `date`/`hangout`
        distinction and lets the model pick whichever fits the current relationship and mood;
        parsing accepts `'hangout'` alongside the existing three kinds.
      - **UI reads correctly as a hangout, not a mislabeled date**: `LiveRapport` takes a `label`
        prop (default `"Live date"`) so the header/VN HUD can pass `"Live hangout"`; `DateEventPanel`
        shows "Live hangout in progress" / "End hangout" with hangout-specific copy; `VNStage`'s HUD
        kind line shows `HANGOUT` instead of `DATE`; every energy/coin toast now names the actual
        scene kind instead of hardcoding "date".
      10 new tests (429 total): `isLiveScene`'s kind/state combinations, `assessDateOutcome`'s
      prompt switching on `sceneKind` (and staying silent on hidden-agenda language when there is
      none), `suggestDateEvent` accepting/offering `'hangout'` and still falling back to `'date'`
      for an unrecognized kind. Verified live end-to-end on Gemma: suggested a hangout card
      ("The Forgotten Spire"), started it (energy spent, world day advanced same as a date), header
      and VN HUD both read "Live hangout" with a real rapport trajectory ("warming to you"), ended
      it via the "End hangout" action, and the judge pass returned modest positive deltas
      (`+4 affection` from `5`→`8`) with a warm, non-verdict recap — no walkout language, no hidden-
      agenda reference, matching the gentler framing by design.
- [x] **Difficulty setting** — done: a global Gentle / Normal / Harsh setting
      (`useSettingsStore.relationshipDifficulty`, a segmented control under Settings → Generation →
      Relationship tracking, next to the existing auto-track toggle). Implemented as a single flat
      multiplier (`scaleDeltasForDifficulty` in `relationshipAssist.ts`: 0.6x / 1x / 1.6x, rounded to
      the nearest integer) applied at the one choke point both scoring paths already funnel
      through — right before a judge call's returned deltas get added to the running
      affection/stats totals — so it changes how far consequences swing without touching the judge
      prompts, the character's own generation, or how a scene opens, matching the roadmap's own
      constraint on this item. Applied uniformly to both `updateAffectionFromReply` (per-turn) and
      `endDateEvent` (end-of-date), so it can't drift into scoring dates and ordinary chat
      differently. Kept global rather than per-world, since a per-world control would need its own
      authoring UI in `WorldsView` for a setting most players will only ever set once. 5 new unit
      tests (`relationshipAssist.test.ts`) cover all three tiers, rounding, and the zero-delta case;
      verified live in Settings (selection switches, persists across reload via the existing
      zustand-persist `rp-settings` key).
- [x] **Breaking the ice + a reactive portrait in the default layout** (#117) — closes out 10b's
      two remaining open items together, since they're both about a live scene actually *feeling*
      live rather than reading as an ordinary chat with a badge on it.
      - **The character opens the scene.** Until now, starting a date/hangout only flipped
        `chat.activeEvent` live — the composer sat empty, waiting on the player to message a
        stranger first. `startDateEvent` (`useChatSession.ts`) now immediately creates a fresh empty
        char message and runs it through the exact same `runGeneration` every ordinary reply uses
        (streaming, scene tags, slop cleanup, the reply-length band, post-reply assists — nothing
        new to keep in sync), with one addition: a new `extraStyleGuidance` option threaded through
        `buildCurrentPrompt`/`runGeneration`'s `opts`, telling the model this is an opening, not a
        response, since the history it's reading may end on its *own* last line from before the
        scene began — a back-to-back-character-turn shape nothing else in the app produces on
        purpose (proactive outreach is the one other place it happens, which is where the existing
        `<START>`/name-prefix dynamic stop sequences that guard against it already came from — this
        reuses that same protection for free rather than needing its own). Written with real names
        (`${speaker.card.name}`/`${persona name}`), not `{{char}}`/`{{user}}` macros — a real
        `styleGuidance` bug caught before it shipped: unlike history turns and the system prompt,
        `styleGuidance` is spliced into the prompt raw, with no macro-substitution pass over it, so
        a literal `{{user}}` would have leaked into the actual prompt sent to the model. Only fires
        for `kind: 'date'`/`'hangout'` (never gift/milestone cards); if another generation is
        already in flight (`runGeneration`'s shared refs genuinely can't run two at once), it skips
        the opener rather than corrupting that state, but says so — a `toastInfo` naming the event
        and telling the player to send a message themselves, so the "breaking the ice" promise never
        silently fails to even attempt.
      - **Grounded in the right moment, not whatever the world clock becomes after it.** Caught
        during polish, not the first pass: 10a's energy economy can force a day rollover the instant
        a date/hangout starts (spending a weekday's last action anywhere from Evening onward jumps
        the *persisted* clock straight to next morning, per `spendEnergy`'s own "never strand the day
        at 0 energy" design) — but `buildCurrentPrompt` reads that live, post-spend state for its
        `worldDescription` line. Without a fix, an opener starting on your last action of the day
        would describe itself as happening the *next morning*, not the evening/night it's actually
        set in. New `activityPhase(day, phaseIndex)` (`calendar.ts`) recovers the moment the action
        itself takes place in — the phase `spendEnergy` stepped into before checking whether a
        *further* rollover was needed, discarded once it decides to sleep — and `startDateEvent`
        snapshots it with `describeWorldMoment` *before* spending energy, threading it into the
        opener's `extraStyleGuidance` (with `{{char}}` resolved by hand, same reasoning as above). 3
        new `calendar.test.ts` cases mirroring `spendEnergy`'s own existing test inputs exactly, so
        the two can be read side by side. **Verified against the real constructed prompt**, not just
        the unit tests: forced the seeded world to Monday/Evening/last-action, patched `window.fetch`
        to capture the outgoing (still-failing, koboldcpp off) request body, and confirmed it read
        *"It's night on a spring monday..."* — while the world's own persisted clock had already
        rolled to day 1, phase 0 (next morning).
      - **A tasteful entrance for the portrait**: `animate-panel-in`, the exact same fade+settle
        every modal/toast in the app already uses on mount, reused rather than inventing a bespoke
        one — already covered by both of this app's reduced-motion guards for free. Fires once, when
        the scene starts (the component mounts/unmounts with `isLiveScene`), not on every expression
        crossfade, which is a separate, plain opacity transition.
      - **A reactive portrait for the default (non-VN) layout.** VN mode's sprite already reacts to
        the model's own scene tags; the plain chat view had no visual equivalent, so a live date
        there read as pure text. New `ReactivePortrait.tsx`, a small floating card (top-right of the
        message area, hidden below `sm` — a phone-width default chat has no room to spare, and VN
        mode is the intended immersive experience there) showing the primary's current-expression
        sprite, gated on `isLiveScene(chat.activeEvent)` so an ordinary chat stays exactly as calm
        and text-focused as before. Resolution logic (expression → sprite → unlock-gated fallback to
        the plain avatar) is copied from `VNStage.tsx`'s own, not reinvented. The crossfade-on-change
        transition both surfaces use is now `useSpriteCrossfade` (`src/lib/hooks/`), extracted out of
        `VNStage.tsx` (previously a private local hook there) so the two can't drift into different
        transition feels — `VNStage.tsx` itself just imports it now, no behavior change.
      - **Deliberately not the full `Scene` entity** section 4/12 already named and deferred (see
        10b's top bullet, resolved here) — this stays layered on the existing `DateEventCard`/
        `isLiveScene` machinery, not a new system.
      No new persisted fields; the opener is a completely ordinary `StoredMessage`, indistinguishable
      from any other reply once it lands (including `endDateEvent`'s own transcript-gathering, which
      already keys on `createdAt >= startedAt`).
      **Verified live end-to-end** (koboldcpp off, per usual for this project's dev sessions — this
      is exactly the scenario the opener's error handling needed to survive gracefully, not just the
      happy path): pre-loaded a draft hangout card onto the seeded Sumire chat and started it for
      real through the actual UI (not a direct API call) — confirmed energy spent and the world
      clock advanced a phase, an objective was created, `activeEvent.startedAt` got stamped (live),
      and a brand-new empty char message was created and run through real generation, which failed
      gracefully exactly the way any other reply does with no model reachable (`failed: true`, the
      existing "⚠ Generation failed — try regenerating" bubble, `isGenerating` correctly reset, no
      exception escaping `startDateEvent`) — proving the graceful-degradation path works, since
      `runGeneration` already catches its own errors everywhere else. `DateEventPanel` correctly
      switched to "Live hangout in progress." In the default layout, the reactive portrait rendered
      in the top-right corner showing Sumire's actual unlocked `neutral` *sprite* (confirmed via its
      real file URL, not just the avatar), with its entrance animation firing once on mount. The
      time-of-day grounding fix above was verified separately, against the real constructed prompt.
      Full suite (449 tests) + typecheck + build all green. Test state (the draft event, the spent
      energy/advanced world clock, the objective, the extra message) was fully reverted after each
      of the two live passes via direct API calls, diffed against a pre-test snapshot field-by-field
      back to identical both times.

### 10c. Relationship depth & lifecycle
- [x] **Multi-dimensional bonds** — done; see the checked item in section 2 for the full
      implementation writeup (`Chat.relationshipStats`, `computeWarmth()`, the 6-stage
      `RelationshipStage` ladder, `assessRelationshipDeltas`). Landed ahead of 10b's live-date
      scoring pass rather than alongside it as originally suggested below — the existing per-turn
      judge call in `relationshipAssist.ts` was extended in place instead of waiting.
- [x] **Store relationship changes as events, not just a running total** — a new append-only
      `relationship_events` table/store (`server/db.ts`, mirroring the `objectives` table's shape;
      `RelationshipEvent` in `types.ts`) logs one record per turn that actually moved something:
      the non-zero deltas, any new scene flags, and a short AI-generated reason
      (`assessRelationshipMoment` now returns `reason` alongside `deltas`/`newFlags` — one extra
      JSON field on the same call, not a second round trip). `Chat.relationshipStats`/`affection`
      stay the fast-read running totals for the hot path (prompt building, unlock checks); the
      event log is the audit trail alongside them, not a replacement — so this is additive, not
      "seven dimensions become a derived sum" as originally scoped. Surfaced as a collapsed
      "History (N)" section in `RelationshipPanel`. Forking (section 4) now clones only the
      events up to the fork's cutoff message, same as it already does for messages/objectives, so
      a branch's history reads correctly for its own timeline. Verified live end-to-end (create →
      list → panel display → cascade-delete on character/chat removal) and wired into
      backup/restore, which silently would have excluded the new table otherwise.
- [x] **Define-the-Relationship ladder** — done. `Chat.commitmentStatus?: CommitmentStatus`
      (`'none' | 'dating' | 'exclusive' | 'living_together'`, `types.ts`) is a separate track from
      the warmth-derived `RelationshipStage` — nothing about it advances automatically. Warmth only
      ever gates whether the *next* tier can be asked for at all (`canAskForCommitment`/
      `commitmentTierThreshold` in `stage.ts`, reusing the exact same warmth milestones already
      authored for `getting_close`/`close`/`sweethearts` rather than a second threshold system);
      whether the ask actually lands is judged by a new `assessCommitmentAsk()`
      (`relationshipAssist.ts`) reading the character's personality and recent conversation, same
      "model plays the character" pattern as `assessDateOutcome`. Three outcomes, not just yes/no:
      accept (status advances, a toast, and a `ChatFact` recording it — same keepsake-memory
      pattern as Milestones), deflect (nothing damaged, asking again later stays possible), or
      backfire (a real relationship cost for genuinely bad timing/delivery) — deliberately never a
      coin flip or a hardcoded "badly timed" rule; the judge call reads the actual scene. An
      explicit non-`'none'` status is also folded into the existing always-on
      `buildRelationshipDescription()` prompt line ("They are officially dating.") so the model
      stays consistent about it turn to turn, not just at ask-time. `RelationshipPanel` gets a
      "Status" row: the current tier, and an "Ask to be X" button once warmth clears the next
      tier's threshold (a locked hint showing the required warmth otherwise). 8 new unit tests for
      the pure ladder helpers (`nextCommitmentTier`/`commitmentTierThreshold`/
      `canAskForCommitment`/`formatCommitmentStatus`). Verified live: the button correctly appears
      only once eligible, correctly reads the required warmth when not yet eligible, and (since
      the judge call itself needs a live model, koboldcpp is off in dev) a failed attempt fails
      gracefully via a toast, leaves the status untouched, and re-enables the button for a retry.
- [x] **Milestones (banner + keepsake memory)** — done, two of this item's four parts (a
      next-morning text needs the proactive-outreach machinery in 10f — that machinery exists now
      (#102), so this is unblocked, just not itself built yet; the social-circle ripple needs
      group/social features, also not built — both stay open). The
      banner already existed (a toast on stage-up); new here is that crossing into a higher warmth
      band now also records a `ChatFact` "keepsake memory" (e.g. `You and Aria's relationship
      recently deepened to "getting close."`), so the model actually knows the relationship
      deepened instead of only the unlock gates silently changing underneath it — reusing the
      exact same synthetic-lorebook plumbing every other fact already rides through. The
      stage-crossing check itself (`crossedMilestone()`) moved to `stage.ts` as an exported pure
      function with its own unit tests (5 cases: forward, multi-stage jump, same-stage, backward,
      reset-to-zero), and a new `announceMilestone()` helper in `useChatSession.ts` replaces what
      used to be duplicated inline at both call sites (per-turn and end-of-date). Verified live:
      since exercising this for real needs a live model judge call (koboldcpp is off in dev), the
      decision logic is unit-tested directly and the `ChatFact` mechanism itself (already proven
      elsewhere) was smoke-tested with this exact milestone-shaped text through the real API and
      `RelationshipPanel` display — round-trips and renders correctly, including the embedded
      quote marks.
- [x] **Breakups & reconciliation** — done, closing out 10c. `Chat.relationshipWarning?:
      { startedAt, reason }` / `breakupCount?: number` (`types.ts`) — only a *committed*
      relationship (`commitmentStatus !== 'none'`) can go "on the rocks" at all: `relationshipAtRisk`
      (`stage.ts`) fires once tension ≥80 or comfort ≤15. A pure `evaluateRelationshipRisk()`
      decides, every time relationship stats get recomputed (not on any separate tick/timer):
      raise a new warning, clear one whose strain resolved, or — once a standing warning's grace
      period (3 real days, chosen over in-fiction days so it works the same whether or not this
      character even has a world/calendar) runs out still at risk — actually break things
      (`commitmentStatus` resets to `'none'`, `breakupCount` increments, and `applyBreakupScar()`
      takes a one-time -15 hit to trust/comfort/chemistry — the "lasting scar," short of a literal
      permanent ceiling that would need every clamp in the codebase to read a per-chat cap). One
      shared `applyRelationshipRisk()` in `useChatSession.ts` wires this into all three places
      relationship stats get recomputed (per-turn, end-of-date, and a DTR ask), so the logic isn't
      triple-implemented. The player can also end things deliberately (`endRelationship()`, behind
      a confirm() in `RelationshipPanel`) — applies the same scar, so a deliberate and an
      unresolved-strain breakup leave the same kind of mark. **Reconciliation needed no new
      mechanics at all**: a breakup just resets `commitmentStatus` to `'none'`, so the existing DTR
      "Ask to be X" flow (this section, above) already lets a player win a character back once
      warmth recovers — the only genuinely new piece is that a character "goes cold": an always-on
      `buildRelationshipDescription()` note fires whenever `breakupCount > 0`, regardless of
      current status, plus a distinct note while a warning is actively standing, so the model
      actually plays the strain instead of just having numbers move underneath it. 13 new unit
      tests for the pure risk/scar functions. Verified live end-to-end: the "On the rocks" banner
      renders correctly; ending a relationship correctly resets status, applies the exact scar
      amounts, and re-opens the "Ask to be dating" path (reconciliation); and the Prompt Inspector
      confirms both the `ChatFact` from a deliberate breakup and the always-on "history between
      them" note actually reach the built prompt.
- [x] **Endings gallery** — done, scoped to today's actual top stage rather than the original
      "living together"/"stable" wording, both of which are Define-the-Relationship-ladder tiers
      that don't exist yet (the bullet above this one is still open) — reaching `sweethearts`,
      today's real highest `RelationshipStage`, is the trigger instead. `GalleryEntry.isEnding?:
      boolean` (`cardSpec.ts`) marks an entry as a once-per-relationship epilogue; a new pure
      `unlockedEndingIds()` (`stage.ts`, alongside `crossedMilestone`) unlocks any not-yet-unlocked
      `isEnding` entries the moment `relationshipStage === 'sweethearts'` — deliberately bypassing
      `detectGalleryUnlocks`'s AI reply-matching pass entirely (an ending isn't "this reply
      pictured this scene," it's "the relationship reached its top tier"), so endings are excluded
      from that pass's candidate list. Reuses the existing `unlockedGalleryIds` set for the
      "once-per-relationship" part — nothing new needed, since an id already in the set is
      naturally skipped from then on. `GalleryView.tsx` shows `isEnding` entries in their own
      "Endings" section per character, with a distinct accent border once unlocked and a "Reach
      Sweethearts" lock message instead of an affection number (`unlockAffection` is authored but
      unused/ignored for `isEnding` entries — the stage crossing is the only trigger).
      `CharacterEditor`'s CG-entry editor gets an "Ending" toggle; `normalizeGalleryEntries`
      (`server/app.ts`) passes the new field through on save. 5 new unit tests for
      `unlockedEndingIds`. Verified live end-to-end: authored a regular CG and an ending entry,
      confirmed the editor toggle state and the Gallery tab's two-section split and lock copy both
      render correctly, then simulated the unlocked state and confirmed the accent border and
      unlock count update correctly.
- [x] **Multi-character relationship tracking** (#118) — the section-10-summary item flagged "real
      scope, not a quick follow-up": until now a group chat's non-primary participants were scene
      NPCs with no tracked relationship of their own — every mechanic in this section and section 2
      (affection, the six stats, commitment/breakups, gallery unlocks, gifts) was hardcoded to the
      chat's primary `character`, even when a *different* participant was the one actually speaking
      or receiving a gift.
      - **The core insight that kept this from being a rewrite**: every one of those functions
        (`computeWarmth`, `relationshipStageForWarmth`, `applyRelationshipRisk`,
        `assessRelationshipMoment`, `unlockedEndingIds`, `detectGalleryUnlocks`, ...) already took
        plain values as params rather than reading `Chat` directly — a pattern this codebase had
        already established for other reasons. So the fix is purely about *what feeds them*, not
        the functions themselves, none of which changed.
      - **New `RelationshipTrack`** (`types.ts`) bundles exactly the fields that need to become
        per-character: affection, the six stats, stage, commitment status, warning, breakup count,
        unlocked gallery ids, and a per-recipient `giftsGiven` tally. `Chat` keeps every one of
        those fields exactly where they've always lived — the primary's own copy, untouched, zero
        migration risk for every chat that predates this — and gains one new optional field,
        `participantRelationships?: Record<characterId, RelationshipTrack>`, for anyone else.
        `getRelationshipTrack`/`patchRelationshipTrack` (`stage.ts`) are the one resolution point:
        which bag of fields a given character reads/writes through. No server schema change at
        all — `chats` was already one JSON blob column per row (see this file's own header note),
        and `PUT /api/chats/:id` was already a generic, un-allowlisted merge.
      - **Scored per-speaker, not per-chat**: `updateAffectionFromReply` (`useChatSession.ts`) now
        takes the actual `speaker` instead of always closing over the primary, and the
        `isPrimarySpeaker` gate that used to skip relationship tracking entirely for a non-primary's
        turn is gone — a live date still suppresses per-turn scoring for everyone (dates stay
        primary-only, unrelated to this), but an ordinary reply from anyone now scores against
        *their own* track, including gallery unlocks read against their own art and affection.
      - **Gifts go to whoever "reply as" is set to**, not always the primary — reusing the existing
        group-chat speaker picker rather than adding a second "give to" control. `giftInventory`
        (owned stock) and `giftCoins` stay a shared wallet, correctly; `giftsGiven` moves into the
        per-recipient track. `BagPanel`'s copy ("give one to X now") was quietly lying about this
        before the fix — caught live, not in review — always naming the primary even when "reply
        as" pointed at someone else.
      - **`askForCommitment`/`endRelationship`** both gained an optional `characterId` (default:
        primary), resolved through the same `resolveSpeaker` group-chat already uses — the DTR
        ladder and breakup/reconciliation mechanics (10c, already fully built) apply to any tracked
        character for free, no new mechanics needed there.
      - **`RelationshipEvent` gained an optional `characterId`** (unset = the primary, so every
        event logged before this exists still reads correctly) and `RelationshipPanel` gained a tab
        switcher — shown only once `participantCharacters.length > 0` — so Bond/stats/status/
        gallery/history all resolve to whichever character's tab is active. Chat-wide state (scene
        flags, `ChatFact`s, the gift/item shops) deliberately stays shared across tabs, not
        per-character — see the doc comment on `RelationshipTrack` for the full list of what's
        deliberately NOT split out.
      - **Character-delete cascade extended**: alongside the existing cleanup that drops a deleted
        character from every chat's `participants` array, it now also drops their entry from
        `participantRelationships` — otherwise a stale tracked relationship could resurface if a
        character with the same id were ever restored from a backup.
      - **Deliberately out of scope**, consistent with this item's own "not the Scene entity" framing
        from the top of 10b: live dates/hangouts stay primary-only (`DateEventCard` has no concept of
        "which participant"), and AI choice-suggestion stays primary-gated (unrelated to the
        affection/stats/gifts/gallery scope this item actually asked for).
      12 new unit tests (`stage.test.ts`): `getRelationshipTrack`/`patchRelationshipTrack` reading
      the primary straight off `Chat`, reading/patching a fresh vs. existing participant entry, and
      confirming a patch to one participant never touches another's. **Verified live end-to-end**
      with a real throwaway participant added to the seeded Sumire chat (koboldcpp off, so the
      generation itself failed gracefully — exactly the scenario that mattered to prove): gave a
      gift with "reply as" set to the participant through the real Bag UI and confirmed, via the
      actual API state, that *only* the participant's track moved (affection, `giftsGiven`) while
      the primary's stayed exactly at 0, the stored message correctly read "I give Rival Ren..." and
      the reply attempt was correctly attributed to them (`speakerId` set, not the primary); opened
      `RelationshipPanel`, confirmed the tab switcher and that each tab showed genuinely independent
      data; bumped the participant's warmth to unlock a DTR ask, clicked it for real, and confirmed
      the graceful-koboldcpp-off failure touched neither track; deleted the test character and
      confirmed the cascade correctly emptied `participants`/`participantRelationships` while
      leaving the chat itself intact. Reverted every mutation afterward (character, messages,
      inventory/coins, participant fields) and diffed the chat back to its exact pre-test snapshot.
      A plain single-character chat (no participants) was re-verified afterward to render exactly as
      before this — no tab switcher, no behavior change at all.

### 10d. Economy, gifts & items
- [x] **Item catalog beyond gifts** — done, scoped to the deterministic half of the originally
      envisioned effect model. `WorldCard.items?: ItemDef[]` (`types.ts`) is a separate per-world
      catalog from `gifts[]` — items are used/consumed for an immediate authored effect, not given
      to a character in a scene, so they never touch `sendUserMessage`'s gift-choice path at all.
      `ItemEffect` is a discriminated union: `relationship` (nudge affection or a stat dimension by
      an authored amount), `flag` (set a scene flag), or `currency` (grant coins) — applied
      instantly and deterministically in a new `useItem()` (`useChatSession.ts`), no judge call,
      since an item's effect is authored, not reacted to. Deliberately NOT included: "permanently
      raise a character's base dating stat" (no such concept exists distinct from the tracked
      `relationshipStats`) and "grant a time-limited buff" (needs a whole new active-effects-with-
      expiry system) — both stay open, genuinely separate efforts. Authoring lives in `WorldsView`
      (an "Item catalog" section mirroring the existing Gift catalog CRUD, with effect-kind-specific
      fields); buying happens from `RelationshipPanel`'s new "Item shop" section (mirroring the gift
      shop); using happens from the Bag (see below), which now shows owned items alongside owned
      gifts. `Chat.itemInventory` is deliberately separate from `giftInventory` — different
      lifecycle (consumed for an effect vs. given away). `normalizeItemEffect`/`normalizeItemDefs`
      (`server/app.ts`) validate the effect union server-side, the same rigor `normalizeGiftItems`
      already gets. Verified live end-to-end: authored an item with a `+5 trust` effect, bought it,
      used it from the Bag, and confirmed `relationshipStats.trust` moved by exactly 5, the item
      was consumed from inventory, and the Bag panel closed automatically afterward.
- [x] **A Bag/inventory view** — done, and it turned out this bullet was really about a gap in
      *giving*, not buying: `buyGift` already only ever added to inventory (buying and giving were
      already two separate steps) — but there was no manual way to actually give an already-bought
      gift at all; the only path was hoping the model happened to suggest it as an AI choice card.
      A new `BagPanel.tsx` (a 🎒 header button in `ChatWindow`) lists owned gifts with a direct
      "Give" button, reusing the exact same `sendUserMessage(..., { choice })` gift-choice path a
      suggested choice already used, so nothing about how giving affects the relationship changes.
      "Given in person on a date" now has a real manual path; "sent by text" stays explicitly out
      of scope — it needs the proactive-outreach/texting machinery from 10f, which now exists
      (#102), but wiring a gift into it specifically is still a separate, un-built piece.
      Verified live end-to-end with koboldcpp running for real: bought a gift, gave it from the
      Bag, and confirmed a genuine model reply and relationship-event log entry both landed
      correctly from the manual give action, the same as an AI-suggested one would.
- [x] **Authored reactions** — done. `Character.giftLikes?: string[]`/`giftDislikes?: string[]`/
      `loveLanguage?: string` (`cardSpec.ts`) sit alongside the existing numeric
      `giftPreferences[-2..3]` rather than replacing it — the number still drives the mechanical
      affection delta (`giftImpactBase` + preference score in `sendUserMessage`'s gift branch),
      staying "deterministic code runs the world"; the new free-text fields feed the model instead,
      so its own freeform in-character reaction is actually informed by what this specific
      character likes, not just personality plus a generic `*I give X gift*` action line. A new
      `buildGiftTasteNote()` folds into the same always-on relationship-description prompt line
      `buildRelationshipDescription()` already builds — not a gift-turn-only prompt section, since
      the model already has it in context the same turn a gift-giving action line appears,
      needing no new "was a gift just given" detection at all. Editable in `CharacterEditor`'s
      existing "Gift preferences" section, right above the per-gift numeric grid. Deliberately not
      added to the character pack format (`pack.ts`) — `weatherPreferences`/`schedule`, both
      already-shipped section 10 fields, aren't in the pack either; growing the pack format is its
      own explicitly-deferred batch (section 7's open item), not something to patch one field at a
      time. Verified live end-to-end: authored likes/dislikes/love-language in the editor,
      confirmed they round-tripped through the API and editor fields correctly, then confirmed via
      the Prompt Inspector that the exact built prompt sent to the model includes the gift-taste
      line, worded naturally rather than as raw data.

### 10e. Character & world authoring depth
- [x] **Guaranteed expression coverage for dates** (#126) — the user's own follow-up request to
      complete section 10's remaining partial items. The reactive portrait (10b, default layout)
      and VN mode's own sprite (`VNStage.tsx`) each independently hard-swapped straight to the
      generic avatar the instant the model's tagged expression had no uploaded (or unlocked) sprite
      — tag "yearning" on a character who only drew "love" and "blush" threw away real, close-enough
      art that already existed. `resolveExpressionSprite()`
      ([src/lib/vn/expressions.ts](src/lib/vn/expressions.ts)) replaces both call sites with one
      shared resolver: exact tag → a hand-authored same-family fallback chain
      (`EXPRESSION_FALLBACKS`, e.g. yearning → love → sad → blush) → 'neutral' → the avatar,
      checking upload *and* unlock status at every step exactly like the exact-tag check already
      did. A deliberate judgment call, not a claim of psychological accuracy — the same "runs the
      world" trade-off already made for scene tags and backgrounds, using the one expression set
      every character already draws from. 17 new tests (`expressions.test.ts`), including two that
      sanity-check the fallback map itself (every id is real, nothing lists itself or 'neutral' as
      its own fallback) — the kind of typo a hand-authored table like this is genuinely at risk of.
- [x] **Full authoring editors** (partial — see below): identity/personality/lore/weather
      preferences already had editors before this pass; added likes/goals/boundaries, social
      connections (who a character knows and how), employment (occupation/workplace),
      home/frequented locations, and one content/feature flag (opting a character out of date
      mode) — three new `CharacterEditor` sections ("Life & background", "Social connections",
      "Content & features"). **Still open**: "dating stats" (a named but never-specified concept —
      revisit once it's clearer what it should mean beyond the `relationshipStats` that already
      exist per-chat) and opting a character out of *specific content* beyond the one date-mode
      flag (needs a real taxonomy of "certain content" first). See section 9's changelog for the
      full writeup, including how the new fields actually reach the model (not just sit in the
      editor) and how the date-mode flag is mechanically enforced, not just informational.
- [x] **AI-assisted authoring from a portrait, reviewed before saving** (#126) — the well-defined
      two-thirds of this item; "roll a set of dating stats" stays open, since that concept is still
      "named but never-specified" per the "Full authoring editors" item just above — building
      something for an undefined ask would be guessing, not completing it.
      `draftCharacterFromPortrait()` ([src/lib/characters/aiAssist.ts](src/lib/characters/aiAssist.ts))
      reuses the exact `images: [base64]` shape `sceneVision.ts` already established for vision
      calls in this app (image → text only — actual image *generation* is section 11's separate,
      already-shipped `ImageBackend` work) to draft a full card from a reference image: name,
      description (matching what the image actually shows), personality, scenario, first message,
      example dialogue. `GenerateCharacterDialog.tsx` gained a "From a brief" / "From a portrait"
      mode `Chip` toggle rather than a second dialog, reusing the same review-before-save flow
      the brief mode already had. "Fitted to the world's tone" (this item's own wording): when a
      world is selected in `CharacterEditor`, its description is passed through as `worldTone` and
      folded into the prompt, so an image-drafted backstory fits the setting instead of contradicting
      it. 7 new tests (`aiAssist.test.ts` — this file's first-ever coverage) confirm the image goes
      out as `images`, never inlined into the prompt text; `worldTone`/brief text are included only
      when actually provided; and a non-JSON response propagates as a real error rather than a
      silently blank card. Live-verified: the mode toggle and portrait upload UI render and switch
      correctly (checked via the real file-picker frame and its help text, not just that a button
      exists) — the actual vision call itself needs a real vision-capable model loaded, which
      wasn't available to confirm this session.
- [x] **"Generate a whole character," not just the card** (#137) — the user's own follow-up ("focus
      on character creation first" of a bigger "AI creates everything" idea). `generateFullCharacter.ts`
      is a staged orchestrator: it drafts the card (`draftCharacterFromBrief`, pulled out of
      `GenerateCharacterDialog` so the orchestrator can call it headlessly, and now folding in
      `worldTone` the way the portrait path already did), then feeds that card forward as grounding
      context into four more focused, individually-parseable calls — `draftCharacterProfile`
      (occupation/workplace/home/haunts/likes/goals/boundaries/love language),
      `draftCharacterBonds` (gift likes/dislikes, weather feelings clamped to `WEATHER_KINDS`, three
      escalating `relationshipStarters` with fresh ids + affection clamped 0-100),
      `draftCharacterOutfits` (2-4 wardrobe states for the Visual novel → Expressions grid — labels
      and unlock gates only, no art, `id`s minted with `slugifyOutfitId`, an `intimate` state also
      flagged `manualOnly`), and `suggestLoreEntries` for a per-character `character_book`. One JSON
      blob for all of it is exactly the shape a local model breaks halfway through; one call per
      artifact is not. Only the card stage is load-bearing — a parse failure in any later stage is
      recorded in `draft.failed` and the run continues, since a character with no drafted goals is
      still perfectly usable. The card prompt itself was rewritten: shared `CARD_FIELD_SPEC` /
      `CARD_PROSE_STYLE` / `CARD_JSON_RULES` blocks across the brief and portrait paths, `first_mes`
      now explicitly asks for `*action*` / `"speech"` markup across 2-4 paragraphs, `mes_example` for
      `<START>`-delimited exchanges, and the style guidance was sharpened to the same house voice as
      `systemPrompts.ts` (was producing flat, unformatted prose before). The per-field "Regenerate
      with AI" button (`regenerateCardField` / `RegenerateFieldButton`) got the same treatment after
      the user flagged its output as "generic, AI sounding and bad": the old prompt said only
      "rewrite this field so it fits" with no target and no style steering. Now it shows the current
      text and asks for a rewrite that keeps its facts, states what a good version of that specific
      field is (`FIELD_GUIDANCE` per description/personality/scenario), carries the shared
      `PROSE_STYLE_CORE` anti-slop block, and — the concrete-beats-abstract trick from `slop.ts` —
      runs `findSlop` on the current text and names the exact tells back to the model to avoid.
      `max_length` 300 → 450, and the button now opens a small popover with an optional steer
      ("colder, ex-military") threaded through as the `hint` param that already existed but had no UI.
      Both the field rewrite and every prose stage of the whole-character generator now also fold in
      the user's global **Writing style** setting (`useSettingsStore.styleGuidance`, Settings →
      Generation) via a shared `writerStyleNote` helper — placed right after the built-in style block
      and told to win on conflict, the same "closest to generation wins" placement `buildPrompt`
      gives it in the live chat prompt — so a generated or rewritten card matches the prose the user
      has asked for everywhere else, not just chat replies. The generate dialog and the rewrite
      popover each show a one-line "Your writing style from Settings is applied" when one is set.
      The dialog gains a "Full character" / "Just the card" scope toggle, a live per-stage checklist,
      and a Stop button wired through a new optional `external` `AbortSignal` on `generateWithTimeout`
      (so Stop aborts the in-flight call instead of waiting out its 45s timeout); `CharacterEditor`
      spreads the returned profile/bonds/outfits/book into its existing field state for review before
      save. `generateFullCharacter.test.ts` (new, 8 tests) plus ~15 `aiAssist.test.ts` additions
      cover the full run, per-stage progress ordering, card-fails-hard vs optional-stage-fails-soft,
      stage selection, the portrait path, between-stage abort, each new primitive's coercion, the
      field-rewrite prompt's grounding / slop-naming / empty-field handling, and the writing-style
      note being folded in (and omitted when blank) across the prose stages. Live-verified: the
      dialog, the scope/mode toggles, the 5-row stage checklist, Stop (aborts and reverts to Cancel
      without closing), and the field-rewrite popover (opens, autofocuses, Cancel closes, shows the
      writing-style line when one is set) all behave correctly; the generation calls themselves need
      a model loaded, which wasn't available this session (koboldcpp off). **Still open**: the same
      orchestration for worlds, lorebooks, and personas — the rest of the "AI creates everything"
      idea — plus wiring an uploaded portrait through every stage, not just the card.
- [x] **API origin check no longer pins the client to port 5173** — surfaced this session: the
      preview/sandbox ran the client on a free port (5173 was already held by another instance), and
      `server/app.ts`'s cross-site guard derived its allowlist from `PORT` (default 5173), so every
      `/api` request from the real port got `403 Forbidden origin` and the whole app rendered with
      "none of your data" — the exact failure `vite.config.ts`'s own comment warns a port collision
      would cause. That check's real job is to reject a request whose Origin is *another website*
      (the browser sets Origin truthfully, so a remote page can't forge a loopback origin); the exact
      port was never the point. Extracted to `server/originCheck.ts` (`originAllowed` kept free of
      `express` so it unit-tests without standing up the app, 4 tests) — now any loopback origin
      (`localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `[::1]`, any port, any scheme) passes and a present Origin on any
      other host is rejected. Live-verified: preview on `:51018` went from empty lists to showing the
      seeded Sumire / Sakura Hill University content.
- [x] **World templates**: a starting point picked when creating a world (Freeform RP / Visual
      Novel / Dating Sim / Slice of Life), pulled forward out of section 10's phase order per
      section 13's own note that it's the structural fix for "which toggles do I want." Shipped: a
      `WorldTemplateGallery.tsx` modal (mirrors the character `TemplateGallery.tsx` pattern) shown
      from "New world," `WorldCard.template?: WorldTemplateId` (unset behaves exactly like
      `'dating_sim'` — the full set, so every pre-existing world is unaffected), and
      `hiddenWorldTabs()` (`src/lib/world/worldTemplates.ts`, unit-tested) narrows which
      `WorldEditor` tabs even show up: freeform hides Dating sim + Clock, Visual Novel and Slice of
      Life each hide just Dating sim, Dating Sim hides nothing. A Chip picker on the Overview tab
      makes the template editable after creation too — switching narrower never touches data
      already entered on a hidden tab, only what's shown. Threaded through `pack.ts` (world
      bundling) and the backup/restore path (already generic, no change needed there).
      **The "gate the actual mechanics, not just the editor tabs" half, done in a follow-up pass**:
      `Chat.assistOverrides?: { autoTrackRelationship?, autoSuggestChoices? }` (`types.ts`) — unset
      falls back to the global Settings → Generation default, same precedence style as
      `Character.instructTemplateId`. `assistOverridesForTemplate()` (`worldTemplates.ts`) seeds a
      brand-new chat's overrides from the bound world's template at creation time
      (`NewChatDialog`): Freeform and Slice of Life (whose own blurbs say "no romance mechanics")
      turn both off; Visual Novel deliberately does not, since plenty of VN stories are
      romance-driven even without the gift-shop economy — only the templates that actually claim
      "no romance" in their own description disable it, not everything that hides the Dating sim
      tab. `effectiveAssistFlag()` (`useChatSession.ts`) resolves the override at all three real
      gate sites (the relationship-description prompt line, the post-reply relationship-tracking
      call, the post-reply choice-suggestion call). Editable after creation too, from two new
      selects ("Use global default" / "On" / "Off") in `RelationshipPanel.tsx` — the natural home,
      since "why isn't this chat tracking relationship" is exactly what that panel answers. 2 new
      `worldTemplates.test.ts` cases. Verified live end-to-end with koboldcpp running: a Freeform
      world's chat sent a real message with neither assist firing (affection stayed 0, no choice
      pills), flipping "Track relationship" to On in the panel persisted immediately and the very
      next real reply *did* update affection while choices correctly stayed off.
      **`visualNovelMode` per-chat/per-world gating, done in a second follow-up pass**: unlike the
      two assist flags above, this is a display-mode/rendering concern (which component even
      renders), not a background model call to skip — but the same precedence pattern still fit
      exactly. `Chat.assistOverrides` gained a third field, `visualNovelMode?: boolean`
      (`types.ts`), same "unset falls back to the global Settings → Appearance default" contract as
      the other two. `assistOverridesForTemplate()` now also seeds it — `visual_novel` forces it
      on, since that template's whole premise is scene-background presentation, unlike the other
      three where VN mode is a legitimate but unrelated choice the user's own global default should
      keep deciding (forcing it off for Freeform/Slice of Life, say, would fight a user who
      genuinely wants VN presentation for a non-romance story). `ChatWindow.tsx` resolves
      `chat.assistOverrides?.visualNovelMode ?? globalVisualNovelMode` once, right after the
      chat-loaded guard, and every existing use of the old plain global read (toolbar tone, the
      header-vs-VNStage branch) picks it up unchanged. Editable per chat from a third select in
      `RelationshipPanel`'s override row, identical UI to the existing two. 3 new/updated
      `worldTemplates.test.ts` cases. **Verified live**: with the global default ON, set a chat's
      override to Off and watched it switch from `VNStage` to the ordinary message-log view
      immediately (header/BOND bar replaced by the normal toolbar and message bubbles); confirmed a
      second, un-overridden chat stayed in VN mode throughout, proving the override is genuinely
      per-chat and the global default still governs everything else; reverted the override back to
      "Use global default" and confirmed the chat returned to VN mode exactly as it started.
      6 new tests (`worldTemplates.test.ts`) from the first pass, 3 more from this one. Verified
      live end-to-end for the template/tab-gating half: created a Freeform world (confirmed Dating
      sim/Clock tabs absent), switched its template chip to Dating Sim mid-edit (confirmed the
      Dating sim tab reappeared immediately), saved a Visual Novel world and confirmed
      `template: "visual_novel"` round-tripped through a fresh `GET /api/worlds`.

### 10f. Proactive, scheduled characters (the core ask)
- [x] **Schedules** — the explicit prerequisite for proactive outreach below, shipped on its own
      since it's fully deterministic (no model call) and therefore fully testable/verifiable
      without a live model loaded, unlike outreach itself. `Character.schedule?: ScheduleEntry[]`
      (`calendar.ts`): a flat list of `{days?, phase, status, activity, location?}` slots — a
      day-specific slot beats an "every day" one for the same time-of-day phase, and an
      unscheduled character (or a scheduled one with no matching slot) just defaults to available,
      never assumed busy. `getCurrentActivity()` resolves what a character is doing right now by
      reading the world's shared clock (`WorldCard.currentDay`/`currentPhaseIndex` — the same
      clock section 10a's weather/mood already read), so it costs nothing new to keep in sync.
      Authored via a new "Schedule" section in `CharacterEditor` (day-pill toggles, time-of-day/
      status selects, activity/location fields). Surfaced in two places: `describePresence()`
      merges a "{{char}} is currently busy — Opening the bakery at Bakery." line into
      `useChatSession.ts`'s `worldDescription` right alongside the existing weather/mood line
      (only for a character that actually has a schedule authored, so an unscheduled character
      doesn't get a generic "is currently free" non-fact injected); `ChatWindow`'s header shows a
      small presence line under the character's name; and `ChatsPanel`'s chat list shows a small
      status dot on the character's avatar (accent when available, muted otherwise), title-texted
      with the current activity — both surfaces the roadmap's original bullet asked for. 8 new
      tests (`calendar.test.ts`), typecheck clean, full suite (94 tests) green. Verified live
      end-to-end: authored a schedule through the real `CharacterEditor` UI (not just the API) and
      confirmed it persisted correctly; advanced the world clock from morning to night and
      confirmed the header badge, the chat-list dot, and the Prompt Inspector's assembled prompt
      all correctly switched from "busy — Opening the bakery" to "asleep — Asleep" together.
- [x] **Durable facts, not just a bigger summary** — the `fact` case of this bullet's original
      four-way vision (event/promise/fact/preference), built as one flat, uncategorized shape
      rather than four typed ones: `ChatFact` (`types.ts` — text, active, sourceMessageId,
      createdAt), a new `chat_facts` table/store, `GET /api/chats/:id/chat-facts` +
      `POST /api/chat-facts` + `PUT /api/chat-facts/:id` (retiring one sets `active: false`, never
      deletes, same audit-trail spirit as the relationship event log above). `assessRelationshipMoment`
      (`relationshipAssist.ts`) now also returns `newFacts: string[]` — one more field on the same
      combined call, not a fourth round trip — told what's already known so it doesn't
      re-extract the same fact every turn. **The elegant part**: facts reach the prompt as a
      synthetic constant lorebook (`useChatSession.ts`'s `buildCurrentPrompt` builds a one-off
      `Lorebook` from active facts and merges it into the existing `lorebooks` array) rather than a
      new prompt section — so they get token-budgeted and placed through `activateWorldInfo` for
      free, AND show up in the Prompt Inspector's existing "World info activated" list with zero
      new transparency code. Verified live end-to-end (create → shows in World info activated →
      appears verbatim in the assembled prompt → cascade-deletes with the chat). A "What {char}
      remembers" section in `RelationshipPanel` shows active facts as click-to-forget chips, plus
      manual add. **Deliberately simpler than originally scoped**: no `event`/`promise`/`preference`
      type distinction or structured fields (who/where/when) — just one free-text sentence per
      fact. Deterministic typed retrieval ("do I have an unfulfilled promise memory") stays open if
      that distinction turns out to matter in practice; the flat version was cheap to ship and
      already covers the given example ("Promised to visit again next weekend" reads fine as plain
      text).
- [~] **A runtime state snapshot assembled fresh per generation**: once schedule/mood/memory/
      relationship state exist, they need a compact, consistent block fed into the prompt each
      turn (location, time, current activity, mood, relevant relationship numbers, a handful of
      the most relevant typed memories, current goal) rather than an ever-growing character card.
      Checked against what `useChatSession.ts` actually assembles today: location/time/activity/
      mood (`describeWorldMoment`/`describePresence`, folded into `worldDescription`), relationship
      numbers (`buildRelationshipDescription`), and current goal (`activeObjective`) were already
      each covered — the "compact, consistent block" ask was more nearly true than this item's own
      wording assumed. The one genuinely missing, and genuinely "ever-growing," piece was memories:
      **fixed live.** `buildFactsLorebook()` (new, `src/lib/worldinfo/facts.ts`) — chat facts now
      go through the exact same per-book `token_budget` cap every other lorebook already had
      (`FACTS_TOKEN_BUDGET = 200`, roughly a "handful" of short one-liners), which they'd silently
      never had before this (an unset `token_budget` defaults to unbounded in
      `activateWorldInfo` — facts were the one book with no cap at all, so a long enough chat's
      memory would grow forever, eventually crowding out either the lore budget or, worse, recent
      conversation history once the outer context budget got tight). Prioritized by recency —
      `insertion_order` derived from `createdAt` rather than a flat constant — since recency is the
      only deterministic relevance proxy available without either a real retrieval system or
      another model call, both bigger asks than this slice. Also found and fixed the same
      unbounded-growth shape in `buildCharacterProfileNote()` (extracted to
      `src/lib/characters/profile.ts`): an author's `likes`/`goals`/`frequentedLocations`/
      `socialConnections` were dumped into the prompt in full every turn with no cap. Now capped
      (8/5/5/6 respectively) — **deliberately excluding `boundaries`**, a character's stated hard
      limits, from any cap: silently dropping one because there were "too many" is a real
      content-safety risk, not just a token-budget nicety, and in practice an author writes a
      handful, never dozens, so leaving it uncapped costs nothing. 13 new tests
      (`facts.test.ts` — including a full pipeline test through the real `activateWorldInfo`, not
      just the lorebook construction; `profile.test.ts`). Verified live end-to-end with koboldcpp
      off (falls back to `estimateTokens` in a few ms, not a hang): a real test chat with 20 facts
      showed exactly the 15 most recent activated and the 5 oldest dropped for budget in the Prompt
      Inspector; a real test character with 20 authored "likes" showed exactly the first 8 in the
      assembled prompt. **Still open**: a true single-field consolidation of these already-separate
      pieces into one literal block wasn't attempted — each already reaches the prompt correctly
      and consolidating working, separately-tested code into one field is a real risk (to a
      heavily-used, well-tested core system) for a mostly-cosmetic gain, not something to do
      without the ability to live-verify generation quality hasn't regressed.
- [~] **Context as an explicit budget, not "fits or gets cut"**: `builder.ts` already trims by
      excluding older messages into the summary when a prompt overflows
      (`excludedMessageCount`/`autoSummarize` in `useChatSession.ts`), but that's the only lever
      today. Once the runtime snapshot above adds several more competing inputs (memories, world
      state, schedule), worth formalizing into priority tiers (character identity and current
      scene are never cut; relationship state and recent dialogue are cut late; retrieved memories
      and background lore are cut first) rather than one undifferentiated pool.
      **The one piece of this taken as a real, safe first slice**: memories (chat facts) are now
      the first category of "retrieved" content with an actual enforced cap at all — see the
      runtime-snapshot item just above. **Deliberately not attempted**: a true cross-cutting tier
      system spanning the *whole* prompt (today's `fixedTokens` — system prompt, world lore,
      character identity, and every activated lorebook entry including facts — is computed first
      and subtracted unconditionally, with only *history* actually competing for what's left; lore
      already has its own independent per-book budget, which is a real form of tiering, just not a
      single unified one). Unifying that properly is a bigger architectural change to a
      heavily-used, well-tested core system, and per this item's own reasoning it's meant to follow
      the runtime-snapshot work rather than be tackled in isolation — verifying it doesn't quietly
      degrade generation quality needs actual live generation to check against, not just token
      counts, so it stays open rather than being rushed through blind.
- [x] **Proactive outreach** — the headline feature of section 10, shipped as a deliberately
      narrow first slice (one-shot check-in texts, primary non-group chats only) rather than the
      full four-way vision (missed dates, unfulfilled promises, social-circle ripples) this bullet
      originally sketched. Two design forks, both resolved with the user before writing code:
      **delivery** — injected directly into the character's existing chat as an ordinary message
      (`StoredMessage.initiatedBy: 'character'`), surfaced by a small unread badge on that chat's
      `ChatsPanel` entry (sibling to the existing presence dot) — no new inbox view, matching this
      project's minimal-UI taste over adding a new nav surface; **trigger** — real wall-clock time
      since the last message in that chat, NOT the in-fiction world day/phase clock (which stays
      exactly as manually-advanced via Sleep as it always has been, untouched by this feature) — a
      character's *current* schedule/mood still flavors eligibility and content, it just isn't the
      timer. Eligibility itself is pure, deterministic code (`evaluateOutreach()`,
      `src/lib/dating/outreach.ts`), matching the established judge-call principle that plain code
      decides game state and the model only writes dialogue: gates on frequency/group-chat/no-prior-
      message/a live `activeEvent`, a frequency-scaled real-silence threshold (rare 48h/normal
      20h/eager 8h), a cooldown floor so rapidly reopening the app doesn't re-roll, the character's
      live schedule status (skipped if `'sleeping'`), then a `seededFraction`-seeded roll — seeded
      by an **hour-bucket of real elapsed silence**, not the frozen world day/phase, since seeding
      off the fictional clock would make a character permanently eligible or permanently not for as
      long as the player leaves that clock alone. A coarse reason (`'silence'|'schedule'|'warmth'`)
      falls out of which condition dominated and becomes a natural-language nudge in the generation
      prompt. The tick itself (`useOutreachTick.ts`) runs once per app session from `App.tsx`
      (guarded against StrictMode's dev double-invoke) — there's no polling/cron infrastructure
      anywhere in this codebase and this doesn't add one, so a character won't text while the app
      is closed, only once enough real time has passed *and* the app is reopened. Iterates
      candidate chats sequentially, not in parallel, matching this codebase's existing avoidance of
      concurrent generation calls against a local single-GPU KoboldCpp server. A real, easy-to-miss
      bug caught and fixed along the way: `PUT /api/chats/:id` unconditionally bumped `updatedAt`,
      so a chat where the tick rolled and decided *not* to text would still jump to the top of
      `ChatsPanel` (sorted by `updatedAt DESC`) with nothing new in it — fixed with a `skipTouch`
      passthrough flag so the tick's bookkeeping-only write (`lastOutreachCheckedAt`) doesn't
      reorder the list. `buildGiftTasteNote`/`buildRelationshipDescription` were extracted verbatim
      out of `useChatSession.ts` into a new `src/lib/dating/relationshipDescription.ts` so the
      headless tick and the live chat hook can share them without duplication. 24 new tests
      (`outreach.test.ts`) cover every eligibility gate, per-frequency thresholds, the skip-vs-
      rolled distinction that decides whether `lastOutreachCheckedAt` gets written, reason
      categorization, and (see below) the defensive output-truncation regression. Verified live
      end-to-end with koboldcpp running for real, including two real bugs the live pass itself
      caught (see the write-up right below this one): the eligibility/generation/persistence loop,
      the unread badge appearing and correctly *not* appearing when the tick fires on the
      already-open chat (checked via `activeChatId` read fresh at insert time, not captured at
      tick-start), and confirmed a `'never'`/unset character (the default — this is opt-in, not
      retroactive) shows zero behavior change.
- [x] **Restraint as part of characterization** — shipped alongside outreach above rather than as a
      separate pass, since the two are inseparable in practice: `Character.outreach?: {frequency:
      'never'|'rare'|'normal'|'eager'}`, unset behaving as `'never'` so shipping this doesn't
      retroactively change any already-scheduled character's behavior. Authored via a new
      "Outreach" section in `CharacterEditor`'s `worldsim` tab, right after Schedule. A character
      that never proactively reaches out is exactly what an unset/`'never'` character already does
      — no separate flag needed for that case.
- [x] **Bug found and fixed during outreach's live verification, affecting the MAIN chat pipeline
      too, not just this new feature**: a real local model (Heimdallr-26B via koboldcpp), when
      uncertain about turn boundaries, would sometimes imitate the SillyTavern `<START>`/
      `{{user}}:`/`{{char}}:` example-dialogue delimiter convention from a character card's own
      `mes_example` field (included verbatim in every prompt via `exampleBlock`) instead of
      stopping after one turn — producing a reply that trailed off into a fabricated persona-voiced
      "turn". Caught live twice: once from outreach's own generation (which structurally invites
      this more, since it deliberately puts two consecutive character turns back to back with no
      intervening player line, a pattern with little precedent in most cards' examples), and
      independently in the user's own live session on an ordinary reply to an image message,
      proving this was a latent bug in `useChatSession.ts`'s normal turn generation all along, not
      something outreach introduced. Root cause: `plain-chat` (this app's default instruct
      template) ships with an empty `stopSequences: []`, relying entirely on the model
      pattern-matching stop points from alternating turns already in the visible history — a
      pattern outreach breaks by design, and one this particular model doesn't always hold to even
      in the ordinary case. Fixed in both places with the same technique: a couple of dynamic,
      always-safe stop sequences (`<START>`, `\n{{persona name}}:`, `\n{{character name}}:`) merged
      into every generation call regardless of template, since no legitimate single-turn reply ever
      needs to emit a literal `<START>` or restate either speaker's name-prefix mid-message.
      Outreach additionally gets a defensive backstop, `truncateAtStrayTurnMarker()`
      (`outreach.ts`), which cuts the returned text at the first stray marker even if a stop
      sequence doesn't catch it cleanly — the same "never trust raw model output" principle
      `relationshipAssist.ts`'s judge calls already apply to structured JSON, just applied to free
      text here. 8 new regression tests for the truncation helper. Verified live by regenerating
      the exact broken message from the user's real session (clean output, referencing the actual
      prior conversation correctly) and by a completely organic follow-up turn the user sent
      mid-session, unprompted by any test setup, which also came back clean.
- [x] **Scenes no longer stay static forever** (#130) — the user's own direct ask, prioritized
      first of a 4-item roleplay-experience list ("Scenes staying static — this is the one to fix
      first"). Ordinary chat had no mechanism nudging the model to ever change the physical
      setting — the scene-tag instruction only ever asked it to *label* wherever the story already
      was. `prompt/sceneProgression.ts`'s `countStaticSceneTurns` (a deterministic turn-counter
      over tagged character turns) plus `sceneProgressionNudge` (a conditional `styleGuidance`
      line, firing only past 6 consecutive turns on the same background) closes the gap, preferring
      the character's own authored schedule location over a generic background list, and
      explicitly suppressed during a live hangout/date (the event itself already is the scene
      change). Live-verified via the Prompt Inspector on a real chat driven to a 6-turn static
      streak — caught and fixed a real bug along the way: `styleGuidance` strings are never
      macro-substituted (only specific named `buildPrompt` fields like `relationshipDescription`
      are), so an initial `{{char}}` in the nudge text was leaking literally into the real prompt;
      fixed to interpolate/phrase around it instead, same fix repeated for every item below.
- [x] **NSFW unlockables: kissing spots, sex positions, toys, and other intimate beats, gated by
      relationship progression** (#131) — item 2 of the same list ("unlocking sex positions,
      places to kiss at, sex toys and more nsfw related things. Be creative"). A ~30-entry built-in
      catalog (`dating/intimacyCatalog.ts`, same shape as `DEFAULT_GIFT_CATALOG`) gated by warmth
      and, for the more involved entries, `CommitmentStatus` — `kissing_spot` entries surface at
      any `IntimacyDetailLevel` (kissing was never gated behind that dial to begin with), while
      `position`/`toy`/`activity` entries only ever surface once the user has actually set it to
      `'explicit'`. `intimacyOptionsGuidance` caps each category to the top 4 (by threshold) so the
      list doesn't grow into a wall of text as more unlocks, and always closes with "never force
      one in just because it's unlocked" — a bank of ideas, not a mandate, same split as #130's
      nudge. Live-verified via the Prompt Inspector at max warmth + `exclusive` commitment with
      Explicit turned on, confirming all four categories appear correctly capped and gated.
- [x] **A `married` commitment tier, above `living_together`** (#132) — item 3 ("unlocking moving
      together, getting married, and other things"; moving in already existed as
      `living_together`, the prior top of the ladder). Purely additive to `stage.ts`'s existing
      generic tier machinery — `COMMITMENT_ORDER` gained one entry, `COMMITMENT_TIER_STAGE.married`
      reuses the `sweethearts` warmth floor `living_together` already needs (the real gate is
      ladder order via `nextCommitmentTier`, not a warmth number no stage would ever clear, since
      sweethearts is already the top of that ladder) — every UI surface
      (`RelationshipPanel`'s ask button, `askForCommitment`'s judge-call flow, toasts, the
      resulting chat fact) is generic over `CommitmentStatus` and needed zero changes. Live-verified
      through the real "Ask to be married" button end-to-end against the user's actual OpenRouter
      backend: one real judge call backfired (character pushed back, stats dropped, ladder
      correctly stayed at `living_together`), a second rejected gently ("let the structure cure
      before adding another floor") — both proving the full accept/reject/backfire pipeline, which
      is otherwise identical code to the already-shipped lower tiers.
- [x] **"Character Mind," scoped to a first real slice: an emotional state and a private
      intention, independent of relationship warmth** (#133) — item 4, off the user's own
      unprompted "Character Mind" brainstorm (personality/emotions/needs/desires/goals/secrets/
      plans/social graph/rumors — deliberately not attempted in one pass; see below for what's
      still open). Ships the two pieces with the clearest payoff on their own, matching the user's
      "Emotion ≠ relationship... someone can love/trust the player while currently being angry with
      them": `RelationshipTrack.mood` (a closed 20-word vocabulary, `prompt/mindGuidance.ts`) and
      `.characterIntent` (a short hidden per-character want, mirroring the player-facing
      `Objective` system but hidden from the player). Both ride inside the *same* judge call that
      already scores relationship movement every turn (`assessRelationshipMoment`) — no added AI
      cost — sticky by default (the classifier is told to omit either key most turns, not reset
      them). Read back into `styleGuidance` via `moodGuidance`/`characterIntentGuidance`, both
      interpolating real names rather than `{{char}}`/`{{user}}` from the start, having learned
      that lesson from #130. Live-verified twice: once via direct DB injection + the Prompt
      Inspector (confirming the injected lines reach the real prompt), once via one real live turn
      against the user's OpenRouter backend — the model's actual reply organically reflected both
      the injected `guarded` mood and the injected private intent (bringing up "the silent vigil"
      unprompted), and the judge call correctly updated `characterIntent` to a new, contextually
      sound read of the scene afterward. The rest of the mindmap (needs/desires/goals/fears/
      beliefs/secrets/plans/social graph/rumors/promises) stays a documented follow-up — section
      12 already sketches related, vaguer precursors ("NPC-to-NPC background simulation," "fog of
      knowledge") this could eventually connect to.
- [x] **"Complete the mind guidance" — a third dynamic dimension (`currentNeed`) plus real UI
      visibility** (#134) — the user's own direct follow-up to #133. Checked first whether the
      *static* half of the mindmap (goals/desires/boundaries/social graph) was actually missing —
      it wasn't: `Character.goals`/`.boundaries`/`.socialConnections` already reach every ordinary
      turn via `characters/profile.ts`'s `buildCharacterProfileNote`, just never wired into
      `draftHiddenAgenda`'s separate date-event params (unrelated, left alone). What was genuinely
      missing: the brainstorm's specific 8-category "needs" list (social connection, solitude,
      achievement, reassurance, excitement, stability, recognition, belonging — `NEED_VOCAB`,
      `mindGuidance.ts`), added as a third field on the same judge call, deliberately written as
      *steadier* than mood (the prompt explicitly tells the classifier not to flip it on one line
      of dialogue) — and the fact that mood/need were completely invisible anywhere in the UI.
      `RelationshipPanel` now shows a small "Right now: guarded · could use more reassurance — a
      passing read, separate from the bond above" line under the warmth bar; `characterIntent`
      stays hidden by design (it's a hidden agenda, not a mood). Live-verified: DB-injected all
      three fields, confirmed the panel renders correctly and the Prompt Inspector shows all three
      guidance lines in the real assembled prompt in the intended order (mood → need → intent).
      What's still explicitly out of scope, named as such rather than attempted: desires, fears,
      beliefs, opinions, secrets-as-first-class-entities, plans-with-interruption, the social graph
      beyond authored `socialConnections`, rumors, promises, internal conflicts — each is a
      structurally different, standalone system (own storage shape, often its own UI), not another
      field on this one judge call.
- [x] **Memory emotion — a durable fact carries how it landed, not just what it was** (#139) — off a
      three-part user brainstorm (memory emotion / relationship momentum / a persistent agency
      layer), taken first as the smallest and cleanest. A `ChatFact` gained three optional fields —
      `importance` (0-1), `valence` (-1..1), `unresolved` — all set by the existing
      `assessRelationshipMoment` judge call (no extra AI cost) and stored in the row's JSON blob, so
      no schema migration and a pre-"memory emotion" fact simply omits them and behaves exactly as
      before. The judge now emits `newFacts` as `{text, importance, valence, unresolved}` objects
      (shared `parseRememberedFacts` still accepts a bare string with neutral defaults, since models
      drift), and — mirroring the numbered-list / index-return shape `pendingTasks` uses — it's
      handed the currently-unresolved threads and can close one via `resolvedFactIndices` (an apology
      that landed, a promise kept). `buildFactsLorebook` moved from pure recency to a
      `factScore` blend (`0.45·importance + 0.3·recency + 0.45·unresolved`) so "forgot her birthday"
      outlives "ordered the pasta", and an unresolved thread gets a content wrapper ("Still
      unsettled, not resolved: …" / "Still an open thread: …") so the model can let it put an edge on
      a later, unrelated moment — a callback without an exposition dump. `assessDateOutcome`'s
      `newFacts` got the same structured treatment. `DirectorPanel` marks an unresolved memory; both
      it and `RelationshipPanel` now filter non-string `text` (a malformed row from a mid-refactor
      HMR half-edit was white-screening the Director panel, and `buildFactsLorebook` skips one too).
      11 new `facts.test.ts` / `relationshipAssist.test.ts` cases (parse both forms + clamp,
      resolve-index filtering, importance-beats-recency, unresolved bump + wrapper, and the
      no-metadata path still ordering purely by recency). Live-confirmed against the real backend:
      the judge produced a properly-structured emotional fact ("Sumire asked Kai to stay silent and
      motionless behind her during intimacy", importance 0.4 / valence 0.5) that persisted and
      rendered correctly. Rest of the brainstorm: momentum landed as #140, the agency/plan layer as #141.
- [x] **Relationship momentum & friction — how fast is this relationship moving, not just where is
      it** (#140) — the second brainstorm slice. The state model is good at "where"; it couldn't say
      "how fast", which is what actually governs pacing (a warmth-90 couple mid-whirlwind and a
      warmth-90 couple in a quiet stretch shouldn't read the same). `Chat.momentum` (top-level for
      the primary, mirrored on `RelationshipTrack`, `getRelationshipTrack`) is one decayed running
      number (`dating/momentum.ts`): each turn `momentum = momentum·0.65 + thisTurn'sWarmthMovement`,
      where warmth movement is the mean of the same five deltas `computeWarmth` averages. Decay makes
      a burst fade over ~5 quiet turns on its own; `noMomentumChange` lets a meaningful decay force a
      small persist even on an otherwise-flat turn. `buildRelationshipDescription` gained a
      `relationshipPacingNote` clause driven by warmth × momentum × tension: "moved fast, treat as
      something to let settle not a standing invitation" / "cooled off lately, more guarded than the
      closeness suggests" / "real friction alongside the closeness — don't let accumulated warmth
      make {char} more receptive than the current strain allows" (the user's "friction ≠ points"
      point) / "steady and comfortable, doesn't need a manufactured development". Plus **diminishing
      returns**: `trailingIntentRun` counts the player playing the same intent chip N turns running;
      at 3+, `dampenRepeatedDeltas` scales that turn's positive warmth gains ×0.4 (negatives and
      tension pass through) and `repeatedIntentNudge` tells the next prompt the character has noticed.
      `RelationshipPanel`'s "Right now:" line shows the momentum band ("deepening fast" / "cooling
      off"). 24 new tests (`momentum.test.ts`, `relationshipDescription.test.ts`, `intent.test.ts` +
      `relationshipAssist.test.ts` additions). Live-confirmed: set momentum on the real Sumire save,
      the panel showed "deepening fast" and the Prompt Inspector carried the friction/receptiveness
      clause into the assembled prompt with the real name. **Still open** from the brainstorm: the
      persistent agency/plan layer (now #141).
- [x] **Persistent agency / plan layer — a character carries turn-spanning intentions of their own**
      (#141) — the last of the three-part brainstorm. `characterIntent` (#133) was one transient
      private want, reset every turn; the user wanted more ("given what she wants, what she's doing
      today, what she knows, and what just happened, what would she naturally do" — cancel plans,
      change her mind, pursue something unrelated to the player, act off-screen between turns).
      `RelationshipTrack.plans` (mirrored on `Chat.plans` for the primary, wired through
      `getRelationshipTrack`/`TrackHost`, JSON blob so no migration) is a list of `CharacterPlan`
      `{ id, goal, kind: 'personal'|'together'|'distance', formedTurn, note? }`, capped at 3 active
      (`dating/plans.ts`). Lifecycle is entirely judge-driven: `assessRelationshipMoment` gained an
      `activePlans` numbered list in and a `planUpdates` array out — `{action:'add'|'note'|'resolve'}`,
      same numbered-list / index-return shape as `pendingTasks`/`resolvedFactIndices` — and
      `applyPlanUpdates` folds them in (dedupes near-identical goals, ages one out past 60 turns as a
      backstop against the judge never closing it, trims to the 3 most recent). Read back into the
      prompt as its own `styleGuidance` line (`plansGuidance`, real names, no `{{macros}}`) right
      after the activity-initiative line: "Beyond just responding to Kai, Sumire is carrying
      intentions of their own... a turn doesn't have to be only about Kai... can drop one if the
      scene makes it moot." `noPlanChange` keeps a flat turn from writing. `DirectorPanel` gained a
      read-only "Plans" section (every field type-guarded before JSX — the object-as-React-child
      crash from #139's mid-refactor half-edit is a known hazard here). 21 new tests
      (`plans.test.ts` — parse/validate, cap, age-out, dedupe, guidance shape; `relationshipAssist.test.ts`
      — schema always present, index-range filtering, omitted → `[]`). Live-verified: seeded a
      throwaway chat with three plans, the Prompt Inspector carried all three into the assembled
      prompt with real names and correct kind framing ("(their own life)" / "(with Kai)" /
      "(holding back)"), the Director panel rendered them without crashing; throwaway chat purged,
      no real save touched. Full NPC-to-NPC background simulation (section 12) stays deferred — the
      lightweight stand-in is a `personal` plan pointed at a `socialConnection`.
- [x] **Relationship panel overhaul: a clean 4-tab layout, real intimacy-unlocks visibility, and
      per-world intimacy-catalog customization** (#135) — the user's own ask, "the relationship tab
      really needs an overhaul... without messy scroll and missing information," broadened
      mid-request to "easier to customize locations, fantasy elements, gifts, sex toys, sex
      positions." Investigation before building anything: custom genres/settings (a Rance
      X/STEINS;GATE/Muv-Luv/CLANNAD-style world) are already fully supported today via
      `WorldCard.lorebook` + `Character.description`/`.personality`/`.tags`/`.character_book` — no
      engineering needed, just explained to the user — and locations/gifts already have full
      editors in `WorldsView.tsx`; the actual gaps were (a) the intimacy catalog from #131 had zero
      per-world customization and zero UI presence anywhere, and (b) the panel itself was 12+
      stacked same-looking blocks in one long scroll. Fixed: `getUnlockedIntimacyOptions`/
      `getIntimacyCatalog`/new `nextLockedInCategory` (`intimacyCatalog.ts`) now merge in a world's
      own `customIntimacyOptions` (additive, same pattern as `customBackgrounds`), with a
      `ListEditor`-based "Intimacy catalog" section in `WorldsView`'s Dating-sim tab mirroring the
      gift editor exactly. `RelationshipPanel.tsx` rebuilt around a pinned summary (bond/mood/
      warning, never scrolls away) plus 4 tabs (Overview/Unlocks/Shop/More), with a genuinely new
      "Intimate unlocks" block in Unlocks grouping what's earned by category with a "next unlock"
      line each — the first time this catalog has been visible anywhere. A "Customize in World
      editor" link jumps straight to the bound world's Dating-sim tab, reusing (and extending with
      a tab-aware `initialTab`) the exact deep-link plumbing the Command Palette's "jump to a
      world" already used. Two real bugs caught and fixed live, not just in review: the tab
      rewrite initially dropped the inner `overflow-y-auto` the old single-scroll layout relied on
      (Modal's own shell doesn't scroll on its own — content has to opt in), silently causing tall
      tab content to overflow uncontained; and the new tab-deep-link raced its own "consumed" signal
      — `WorldsView` read `initialTab` straight from a prop that the parent cleared in the same
      render batch that mounted `WorldEditor`, so the target tab was already `null` by the time it
      was read, fixed by latching it into local state the instant a match is found (same reason
      `pendingTemplate` already avoided this exact race for `initialTemplate`). Live-verified
      end-to-end: added a custom catalog entry through the new editor, confirmed it appears in the
      panel's Unlocks tab once its threshold is met and in the real assembled prompt via
      `intimacyOptionsGuidance` once `intimacyLevel` is `'explicit'`, and confirmed the customize
      link now lands directly on "Dating sim," not just the world's overview.
- [x] **Unlocked ≠ usable: every intimacy-catalog entry becomes a real, clickable action, toys
      become an actual purchase, and a deliberate "first time together" milestone** (#136) — the
      user's own direct follow-up to #135/#131: "we should be able to choose 'unlock kiss', and
      then choose where to do it and how... or like lose virginity, or buy toys." Until now,
      "unlocked" only ever meant "the model may draw on this" — nothing to click, nothing to buy,
      nothing to deliberately initiate. Three pieces: (1) every `IntimacyUnlockable` gained a
      hand-written `actionText` (all ~37 built-in entries, not a templated sentence — a generic
      "does {label}" line read badly across this varied a catalog), sent verbatim as the player's
      own message via `composeIntimacyActionText` + the exact mechanism Quick Replies already use
      (`sendUserMessage`, "sends immediately, exactly as if you'd typed and sent it yourself"),
      closing the Relationship panel so the reply generates right there; (2) toys gained a `price`
      and `Chat.toyInventory` (byte-for-byte mirroring `giftInventory`/`itemInventory` and
      `buyGift`/`buyItem`'s own shape) — `getUnlockedIntimacyOptions` gained an `ownedToyIds` filter
      so a toy only ever reaches the model, or becomes clickable in the panel, once actually bought,
      warmth/commitment now only gating *eligibility to buy*; (3) `assessIntimacyMilestone`
      (`relationshipAssist.ts`) + `initiateFirstTime` (`useChatSession.ts`) — a deliberate ask
      mirroring `askForCommitment`'s exact accept/deflect/backfire judge-call shape, gated by a new
      `canInitiateFirstTime` (warmth ≥75 + any real commitment), persisting `firstIntimateSceneAt`
      only on accept and deliberately not auto-sending a narrative line afterward — this beat is big
      enough that the player's own next message should carry it. Caught one real accessibility
      regression live, not in review: every pill's `title` was the identical generic "Click to do
      this now"/"Buy for N coins," giving a screen reader no way to distinguish which of 15+ items
      it was announcing — fixed to include the item's own label. Live-verified end-to-end against
      the real backend: clicked a kissing-spot pill and confirmed the exact authored line
      ("*leans in and presses a slow kiss to Sumire's forehead*") landed as a real sent message with
      a real generated reply; bought a toy (refused at insufficient coins, succeeded once funded,
      pill flipped to its usable state, and the Prompt Inspector confirmed only the bought toy ever
      reached the model, not the other eligible-but-unbought ones); and ran the first-time-together
      ask twice against the real backend, getting a live deflect outcome and then a live 429 from
      the provider — both handled correctly (state left untouched, the error surfaced as a toast)
      without needing to force an accept outcome to trust code that's structurally identical to the
      already-proven `askForCommitment` accept path.
      **Follow-up (#138, user-reported): the action lines were too terse and always identical** — a
      clicked "missionary" sent a flat `*guides Sumire onto their back*` with nothing telling the
      model what was actually being initiated, so the reply often glossed straight past it. Rewritten
      on two fronts. (a) Every built-in `actionText` is now a fuller, first-person line, and every
      entry gained a `promptNote` — a plain, model-facing description of the physical act ("the
      missionary position: {char} on their back, you over them, face to face"). `intimacyActionDirective`
      turns that note into a directive injected into the *character's* reply turn via
      `runGeneration`'s `extraStyleGuidance` ("Kai has just moved the scene into ... write Sumire's
      response to it as the actual next beat"), so the model can't miss it. (b) Clicking an option no
      longer auto-sends a canned line: `draftIntimacyAction` (mirroring `impersonate` — the
      `IMPERSONATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` plus the promptNote as a brief) has the connected model rewrite
      the move for the scene as it stands (what was just said, the mood, state of undress), and the
      result lands in the composer for review, the option armed via a new `armedIntimacyOptionId` so
      a real send still fires the outfit-switch / aftercare side effects. Falls back to the entry's
      hand-written line if the model call fails or times out (both `draftIntimacyAction` and
      `impersonate` are now wrapped in `generateWithTimeout`, a latent gap). New
      `intimacyCatalog.test.ts` cases for `resolveIntimacyPromptNote`'s fallbacks and the directive's
      shape, plus a `promptNote`-coverage assertion over the whole catalog. Live-verified against the
      warmth-96 Sumire save produced a scene-adapted first-person line in the composer ("*I shift my
      weight, easing Sumire down onto her back against the cushion, my hands guiding her hips as I
      settle between her legs.* \"Here.\" ...") — far more than the old one-liner; the reply-turn
      directive is unit-tested but wasn't sent into the real save to keep it clean.

**Suggested phase order** for this whole section, since it's too large for one pass — updated now
that the 7-dimension/warmth rework (originally step 4, deferred until after 10b) landed early: (1)
mood-of-day + a minimal calendar/clock, since almost everything else reads from them; (2) proactive
outreach on top of that clock (10f) — it's the headline feature and forces the memory/schedule
groundwork to exist for real, not speculatively; (3) live date/hangout mode (10b), now feeding the
already-multi-dimensional relationship model instead of the old 4-stage one, plus the remaining
10c lifecycle pieces (event-sourced history, the Define-the-Relationship ladder, breakups/
reconciliation, endings gallery) once 10b's scoring pass exists to hang them on; (4) economy/
energy/weather and the expanded item catalog (10a remainder, 10d) once there's an actual game
loop worth spending energy and money in; (5) authoring depth (10e) throughout, as each system
above creates new fields to author.

## 11. Image/asset generation backends
- [x] **A1111, ComfyUI, SwarmUI, and NovelAI as four `ImageBackend` implementations** (#124) — the
      user's own direct follow-up once section 8's NovelAI text backend (#123) showed it also has
      hosted image generation, asking to keep going through the night with the rest of section 11
      while away: "figure out how to implement SwarmUI api, A1111 Stable diffusion API, ComfyUI
      API, and any others." One shared interface as this section's own note already called for —
      `ImageBackend` ([src/lib/api/imageBackend.ts](src/lib/api/imageBackend.ts)): `generateImage`
      (prompt/negative/width/height/steps/cfg/seed/model → base64 PNG + the seed actually used) and
      `listModels` (best-effort — an empty array, not an error, when a backend has no such
      introspection or is unreachable), the same "one interface, many providers" shape as
      `ChatBackend`/`ttsProviders.ts`. `createImageBackend()` is the matching factory.
      - **Automatic1111 / Forge** ([src/lib/api/a1111Image.ts](src/lib/api/a1111Image.ts)) — the
        most standardized of the four; `POST /sdapi/v1/txt2img`, base64 images in the response's
        `images` array, `GET /sdapi/v1/sd-models` for the checkpoint list, optional HTTP Basic auth
        for a server launched with `--api-auth`. Confirmed from the project's own official wiki.
      - **ComfyUI** ([src/lib/api/comfyuiImage.ts](src/lib/api/comfyuiImage.ts)) — no "just send a
        prompt" endpoint exists; every request is a full node-graph workflow. Uses ComfyUI's own
        official default txt2img graph (from its `script_examples/basic_api_example.py`:
        CheckpointLoaderSimple → two CLIPTextEncode → EmptyLatentImage → KSampler → VAEDecode →
        SaveImage) with this app's params substituted in, `POST /prompt` to queue, polls
        `GET /history/{id}` for the output filename, then `GET /view` for the actual bytes. Works
        for a standard install; a heavily customized workflow of the user's own isn't supported —
        flagged as a real, deliberate limitation rather than attempted and possibly wrong.
      - **SwarmUI** ([src/lib/api/swarmuiImage.ts](src/lib/api/swarmuiImage.ts)) — session-based:
        `POST /API/GetNewSession` (cached, refreshed exactly once on the documented
        `invalid_session_id` error) then `POST /API/GenerateText2Image` with params at the same
        JSON level as the session id, confirmed from SwarmUI's own official `docs/API.md` and
        `docs/APIRoutes/T2IAPI.md`. Individual parameter names (`negativeprompt`, `cfgscale`, ...)
        follow its documented convention but weren't each individually confirmed in the source
        actually reached — the lowest-confidence piece of the four. `listModels` returns `[]`: no
        confirmed model-listing endpoint found, left honest rather than guessed at.
      - **NovelAI image** ([src/lib/api/novelaiImage.ts](src/lib/api/novelaiImage.ts)) — same
        account/`Authorization: Bearer` as #123's text backend, `POST /ai/generate-image`, but a
        genuinely different response: a ZIP archive (one PNG inside), not a plain image or JSON.
        `extractFirstFileFromZip` ([src/lib/api/binaryUtils.ts](src/lib/api/binaryUtils.ts)) reads
        the local-file-header directly rather than adding a zip dependency, and handles both
        compression methods actually seen in the wild (stored and deflate) via the standard
        `DecompressionStream` Web API — genuinely tested with real compressed and uncompressed
        fixtures (`node:zlib`-produced, not mocked), unlike the rest of this feature.
      - **Settings UI**: a new "Images" tab ([src/components/settings/ImageGenSettings.tsx](src/components/settings/ImageGenSettings.tsx))
        — backend picker, a server-URL field for the three local backends (pre-filled with each
        one's own conventional default port on first pick), optional Automatic1111 Basic-auth
        fields, and a model field, all following the same flat-settings-plus-one-setter shape as
        the chat and TTS backends.
      - **A first real generation UI, deliberately minimal**: `GenerateImageButton`
        ([src/components/ui/GenerateImageButton.tsx](src/components/ui/GenerateImageButton.tsx)) —
        a small inline prompt popover, wired into the character editor's avatar slot only, seeded
        with the character's own description as a starting prompt. Proves the whole interface end
        to end from a real UI rather than shipping four backends nothing in the app actually calls;
        wiring the same button into VN sprites/backgrounds/gallery CGs, and the fuller "generate a
        whole expression set in one pass with real scene context" vision, stay open — see the item
        just below, unchanged from before this entry.
      - **Verification, split the same way as #123**: the genuinely testable half (ZIP extraction,
        base64 round-tripping) is verified with real bytes, not mocks — `binaryUtils.test.ts`.
        Everything that needs an actual server is mocked against each project's own documented
        contract: 26 new tests across `binaryUtils.test.ts` and the four clients
        (`a1111Image.test.ts`, `comfyuiImage.test.ts`, `swarmuiImage.test.ts`,
        `novelaiImage.test.ts`) covering request shape, response parsing, the ComfyUI
        default-workflow substitution, SwarmUI's session-retry behavior, and error handling. 546
        tests total, typecheck and build clean. **A1111, ComfyUI, and SwarmUI have not generated a
        single real image** — no local install of any of the three was available to test against.
      - **NovelAI image — a real partial live check, from a free trial account**: triggered for
        real through `GenerateImageButton` in the actual character editor UI, not a synthetic
        script. The result is genuinely informative rather than a clean pass or fail: NovelAI
        returned a structured `400` — `{"statusCode":400,"message":"Recaptcha token is required
        for trial generation"}` — which confirms the request actually reached NovelAI's real
        business logic correctly (the `Bearer` auth was accepted, and the JSON body parsed cleanly
        enough to be evaluated, not rejected as malformed) before being blocked by a trial-account-
        specific anti-abuse gate this client has no way to satisfy — and, per this app's own safety
        rules, no attempt was made to. This is very likely trial-tier-only (the message says so
        explicitly); a paid account would need its own check to confirm. Text generation was not
        also tried against this same key — out of scope of what was actually asked for this pass.
- [x] **Generate directly into a specific slot, with context** (#125) — closes out section 11.
      `GenerateImageButton` ([src/components/ui/GenerateImageButton.tsx](src/components/ui/GenerateImageButton.tsx))
      is now wired into every existing image slot instead of only the character avatar: per-expression
      sprites, world scene backgrounds, and gallery CGs, each seeded with real context instead of a
      blank box — the character's own description for sprites, `{background label}, {world
      description}` for backgrounds, and `{character}, {unlock hint}, {title}` for a gallery CG (the
      unlock hint doubling as the "as if reacting to X" scene context this item's own wording asked
      for). Portrait slots default to 832×1216, landscape ones to 1216×832 — SDXL's own native
      bucket resolutions, not the SD1.5-era 512×768 this first shipped with.
      - **The headline piece**: `GenerateExpressionSetDialog`
        ([src/components/characters/GenerateExpressionSetDialog.tsx](src/components/characters/GenerateExpressionSetDialog.tsx)) —
        one base appearance description, a `Chip`-based pick of which of the 21 expressions to fill
        in (pre-selected: whichever don't already have art, so a bulk run defaults to filling gaps
        rather than clobbering existing custom sprites), then one generation call per expression,
        **sequential, not parallel** — the same reasoning this codebase already applies to a local
        single-GPU KoboldCpp server extends just as much to a local Stable Diffusion one. Each
        sprite lands in its slot the moment it finishes rather than waiting for the whole batch, a
        Stop button halts before the next one, and a failed expression is collected into a results
        summary rather than aborting the rest of the run. Directly closes section 1's outfit/pose-
        layering note ("would make layering far more tractable once art can be generated on demand")
        and section 10's "guaranteed expression coverage for dates" bullet, exactly as this item's
        own original wording anticipated.
      - **A real bug caught before it shipped**: the Stop button's first version checked the
        `stopRequested` *state* variable inside the generation loop — a plain React state read
        inside an already-running `async` closure that a later `setStopRequested(true)` re-render
        can't actually change from the closure's point of view, so Stop would visibly react (button
        text flipped to "Stopping…") while never actually halting anything. Fixed by checking a
        `useRef` instead, mutated in place and read fresh every loop iteration.
      - **Verification**: live in the browser, for real, against the NovelAI image backend
        configured in #124 — with a real (if trial-restricted) account, not a mock. Selected 2 of 21
        expressions, ran the batch, and both calls returned NovelAI's real, already-known trial
        reCAPTCHA error; the dialog handled it exactly as designed — collected both failures without
        aborting, showed a clean results summary, and transitioned its footer from Cancel/Generate to
        Close correctly. This is genuine end-to-end verification of every piece of the batch
        orchestration except the success path itself (which the avatar button's own earlier
        successful `result.base64` → `data:image/...` flow already exercises) — still no backend in
        this app has produced a real generated image. Also confirmed live: the per-slot buttons on
        backgrounds and the gallery CG render in the right place and build the right context-seeded
        prompt (checked via each field's actual DOM value, not just that the button appears).

## 12. Vision: platform-scale ideas (not scheduled)

Speculative, larger-than-section-10 ideas surfaced during a roadmap review — captured here so
they're not lost, deliberately kept separate from section 10's phase order so they don't compete
for priority with what's actually planned. Revisit once the section 10 core (world clock,
proactive outreach, live dates, relationship lifecycle) is real and in use — several of these are
much easier to reason about with that foundation already built, and some may turn out unnecessary
once it exists.

- [x] **A director/debug view**: read-only inspector panels for a character's current mood,
      location, relationship numbers, and recent memories, plus manual world-state controls for
      testing (advance time, trigger an event, set a relationship value, hand over an item) —
      makes iterating on a world dramatically faster than playing through it manually every time,
      but is really a creator/power-user tool layered on top of section 10 rather than part of it.
      `src/components/chat/DirectorPanel.tsx` (new), opened from a new `Wrench` icon in
      `ChatWindow.tsx`'s shared toolbar (both normal and VN mode get it for free, same as every
      other panel there). Deliberately built as a layer *on top of* existing mechanics rather than
      a new system — every control goes through the same `chatsApi`/`worldsApi` PUTs and the same
      deterministic `calendar.ts` reads the ordinary chat UI already uses, nothing new is stored:
      - **World & time**: season/day/weekday/phase/holiday (`getCalendarInfo`), weather
        (`getWeather`, deterministic per world+day), the character's mood-of-day (`getMoodOfDay`)
        and current schedule presence/location (`getCurrentActivity`) — all read live, since none
        of them are actually stored fields (see below). "Advance time" steps the world's shared
        clock forward one phase (`advancePhase` + `worldsApi.update`), the same call the World
        editor's own "Advance clock" button already makes.
      - **Relationship**: live warmth/stage/commitment display plus a number field per dimension
        (affection + the six `RELATIONSHIP_DIMENSIONS`) that PUTs the new values via
        `chatsApi.update` and logs a `relationship-events` audit entry for any dimension that
        actually changed (a no-op Apply logs nothing — verified live).
      - **Scene flags**: a toggleable pill per flag (built-in + world-authored), direct
        `chatsApi.update({ sceneFlags })` — the lightweight stand-in for "trigger an event"; a full
        `DateEventCard` still belongs to the existing Event panel, not duplicated here.
      - **Recent memories**: the chat's active `ChatFact`s, newest 8, read-only.
      - **Hand over an item**: a direct gift/item inventory grant (`chatsApi.update` on
        `giftInventory`/`itemInventory`) — distinct from `BagPanel`'s "Give," which sends an
        in-scene chat message; this is a pure debug stock addition with no narrative side effect.
      **One real, deliberate scope cut**: "change the weather" from the original wording isn't a
      control, because weather was never stored — `getWeather(worldId, day)` is a pure
      deterministic hash of world id and day, recomputed on demand precisely so it never needs
      persisting (see `calendar.ts`'s own header comment). Making it independently settable would
      mean adding a stored override field that fights the existing "nothing here needs its own
      storage" design, for a testing convenience "advance time" mostly already covers (a few
      advances cycles through different deterministic weather for free). Left undone rather than
      forced in.
      **Live-verified in browser, on the actual in-progress Sumire save** (warmth 96, `sweethearts`/
      `living_together`, real chat-fact history) rather than a throwaway fixture, so every mutating
      control was snapshotted first and reverted after: toggled a scene flag on/off (round-tripped
      through the UI itself); advanced the world clock a phase (Morning → Afternoon, confirmed in
      the panel's own display, then restored via a direct API call since there's no "undo" control
      in the UI); clicked Apply with unchanged values (confirmed the PUT succeeds and, correctly,
      logs no relationship-event — checked the event list directly); granted a gift (confirmed
      `giftInventory` gained the new entry, then restored the original inventory exactly). Final
      state diffed field-by-field against the pre-test snapshot and confirmed identical.
- [ ] **Save slots** distinct from chat history: a named, full-state snapshot (world state,
      character states, relationships, inventory, calendar, flags) a player can return to, rather
      than a chat transcript being the only unit of "where I am in the story." Chat forking
      (section 4) already does something adjacent for one conversation; this would be the
      world-level version once there's actual world state to snapshot.
- [ ] **A visual story-branch tree**: once forking is well-used, a graphical view of a chat's
      fork history (branch points, where they diverged, which is active) rather than the current
      flat chat-list-with-badges — closer to a save-tree browser than a list.
- [ ] **NPC-to-NPC background simulation**: relationships and events between characters that don't
      involve the player directly (two characters' friendship souring, one covering a shift for
      another), resolved as lightweight deterministic state changes rather than full LLM-generated
      scenes, with a model call spent only when the player actually witnesses or asks about it —
      keeps a populated world computationally affordable. The lightweight stand-in exists as of #141:
      a `personal` `CharacterPlan` can be pointed at a `socialConnection` ("patch things up with her
      sister"), so a character's own dialogue can reflect an offscreen relationship without any
      actual second-character state being simulated. The full version is a separate system.
- [ ] **A town/social feed**: an in-world feed of posts characters make based on their own lives
      (schedule, mood, recent events), giving the player an indirect, ambient way to learn what's
      happening without it being narrated at them directly.
- [ ] **Fog of knowledge**: the player doesn't automatically know everything the simulation knows
      — a character's private mood swing, a fight between two NPCs — unless they witnessed it,
      were told, or it surfaced through the social feed above. Distinguishing "world truth" from
      "what a given character knows" from "what the player has learned" is what makes information
      (and withholding it) meaningful, but is a genuinely tricky piece of state to track correctly
      and probably not worth attempting before the simpler proactive-outreach/memory work in
      section 10f is solid.
- [ ] **A plugin/extension API**: hooks (before/after generation, on message, on day-advance, on
      relationship change, on memory created) plus UI extension points, so features like a Discord
      bridge, a custom minigame, or an alternate relationship system could be built without
      forking the app. This is how a project this size could grow a feature surface comparable to
      SillyTavern's extension ecosystem without personally building all of it — but it's also a
      real API-design and stability commitment, worth doing once section 10's core data model has
      actually settled rather than before.

## 13. Onboarding, first-run & discoverability

Everything above assumes a user who already knows what a character card, a lorebook, an instruct
template, and a KoboldCpp URL are. A first-time user gets none of that. Verified state today:
`App.tsx` mounts straight into the chat view; there is no first-run flow, no connection wizard, no
"make your first character" path. The empty states that do exist (`CharacterList.tsx`,
`WorldInfoView.tsx`, `ChatsPanel`) are plain paragraphs, not actionable. Connection is configured
only by typing a URL into Settings → Connection and reading a passive status dot
(`ConnectionSettings.tsx`) — nothing routes a new user there or reacts when it's wrong. The one
thing that keeps a fresh install from being completely empty is the bundled seed content
(`server/seedContent.ts` — the "Sakura Hill University" world + Sumire + a demo World Info book,
changelog #49), and nothing points the user at it.

- [~] **First-run wizard** — a `WelcomeView` (`src/components/chat/WelcomeView.tsx`) now takes
      over the chat tab whenever there are zero chats (`ChatSurface` wrapper in `App.tsx`). Two
      cards: **(1) Connect your model** — the live `useConnectionStatus` state, and when offline it
      quietly probes `:5001` / `127.0.0.1:5001` / `:5000` in the background and offers a one-click
      "Use it" if one answers, plus an inline URL field (no trip to Settings), the `--host
      0.0.0.0` hint, and a "you can do this later" note; **(2) Start your first chat** — the
      seeded Sumire featured with her avatar/description and a "Chat with {name}" button that opens
      `NewChatDialog` pre-selected (new `initialCharacterId` prop), or, if no character exists, a
      "Create a character" / "Import a card" pair that routes to the Characters tab. Verified live
      end-to-end (offline probe path, "Chat with Sumire" → dialog → running chat, and the view
      correctly reappearing when the last chat is deleted).
      **Deliberately not done**: a multi-screen stepper and a forced persona-creation step —
      persona quality still matters (item 41), so the persona nudge below stays open as its own
      lighter change.
- [x] **Actionable empty states** — done. The authoring-UI rebuild (#57) gave Characters / Worlds
      / Personas / World Info a dashed card with a primary "Create your first…" button; the
      zero-chats case is now the full `WelcomeView` (#62) with the "Chat with Sumire" shortcut the
      "use the bundled character" ask wanted. (`ChatsPanel`'s own "No chats yet." line is now
      unreachable — `ChatSurface` renders the Welcome screen instead — but left in as a defensive
      fallback.)
- [x] **Persona nudge** — done. When there are no personas yet, `NewChatDialog` swaps the
      "Default (You)" dropdown for two inline optional fields — "Your name" and "A line about who
      you are" — and on start it mints a reusable persona from them and links the chat to it (so
      the model gets a real name/description instead of the hardcoded `'You'`, per item 41). Blank
      is still fine (falls back to "You"). Once a persona exists the normal dropdown returns.
      Verified live: "Kai / A transfer student…" round-tripped into a saved persona linked to the
      new chat, header showed "as Kai".
- [~] **Inline help on the dense authoring screens** — largely addressed by the authoring-UI
      rebuild (changelog #57): `CharacterEditor`'s ~15 stacked `<details>` are now 7 tabbed
      sections (Identity / Life / Visual novel / Dating sim / World sim / Voice / Advanced), each
      `Section` carrying a one-line description; `LorebookEditor`'s per-entry knobs collapse behind
      an "Options" disclosure with the power-user fields (order, position, chance, group, secondary
      keys) hidden by default; `WorldEditor` got the same tab treatment. Still open: `(?)` popovers
      for the genuinely opaque ones (regex key syntax, inclusion groups, the sampler params in
      `SamplingControls`), and a true "Basic" mode that hides whole tabs for a first character.
- [x] **VN mode reads as broken before art exists** — enabling `visualNovelMode` with a character
      that has no sprites and a world with no backgrounds showed a placeholder gradient and a
      full-bleed avatar/initials, which looks like a bug rather than a "you haven't uploaded art
      yet" state — and the silent variant found live (a fully-sprited character with `worldId`
      unset, so *nothing* can source a background) had no indication anywhere that binding a world
      was the missing step. Shipped the "clear empty-VN affordance" option: `vnArtHint(character,
      world, dismissedIds)` (`src/lib/vn/artHint.ts`, pure, 6 tests) names the *one* specific
      missing piece in priority order — no sprites → "add art in the character editor's Visual novel
      tab"; sprites but no world → "assign one from the Identity tab"; world but no backgrounds →
      "add them in the world editor". `VNStage` renders it as a dashed glass card centred in the
      sprite area (so an empty stage reads as intentional), dismissible **per-character** via a new
      persisted `vnArtHintDismissed: string[]` in `useSettingsStore` — so a deliberately art-less
      character stops nagging while a brand-new one still gets told. Plus the editor nudge this item
      asked for: `CharacterEditor`'s Visual novel tab shows a one-line note when the character has no
      `worldId`, with an inline jump to the Identity tab, explaining that backgrounds are a
      world-level concept separate from sprites. Live-verified: the VNStage card renders for a
      sprite-less character in VN mode, the × dismisses it and persists, and the editor note
      appears/disappears as a world is picked.
- [x] **Command palette / global search (Ctrl/Cmd-K)** — jump to any character, chat, world, or
      view from one input. `src/components/layout/CommandPalette.tsx` (new), wired into
      `src/App.tsx` via a global `keydown` listener and a search-trigger button in
      `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` (desktop-only — the mobile bottom bar has no room and a
      keyboard shortcut isn't the point on a touch device). An empty query shows the view list
      (`NAV` from `Sidebar.tsx`, exported for this); a non-empty query searches chats (title +
      character name), characters (name), and worlds (name) in parallel, capped at 6 results per
      group. Arrow keys move the highlight, Enter activates, Escape or a backdrop click closes.
      Selecting a character or world result deep-links straight into that item's editor —
      `CharactersView`/`WorldsView` gained optional `initialCharacterId`/`initialWorldId` +
      `onConsumedInitial` props, consumed once via a `useEffect` keyed on the id (not on every
      `characters`/`worlds` refetch, which would otherwise snap the view back open after a save).
      Selecting a chat result sets `activeChatId` and switches to the chat view; selecting a view
      result just switches views.
      **Live-verified in browser, and it caught a real bug in the process**: the `results` array
      that keyboard navigation indexes into was built in group order `View, Chat, Character,
      World`, but the grouped render walked `View, Character, Chat, World` — a different order.
      Whenever both chat and character results were present, the row shown as "active" (highlighted
      via the render-order index) and the row `Enter` actually activated (`results[clampedIndex]`,
      the array-order index) were two *different* items — confirmed by searching "Sumire" (which
      matched both a character and a chat) and watching Enter open a **chat** while a **character**
      row was shown highlighted. Fixed by reordering the `results` array construction to match the
      render's group order, and — to make this class of bug structurally impossible going forward —
      replaced the separately-hardcoded `['View', 'Character', 'Chat', 'World']` render-group list
      with one derived from `results` itself (`[...new Set(results.map(r => r.group))]`), so the
      keyboard index and the visual grouping can never drift apart again. Re-verified after the fix:
      query filtering across all three entity types, Arrow Up/Down moving the highlight in true
      visual order, Enter activating exactly the highlighted row, mouse click/hover doing the same,
      and Escape closing cleanly with no state left behind. Overlaps with the existing message
      `SearchPanel` (section 4) — could be unified into one surface later, not done here.
- [x] **Discoverable keyboard shortcuts + a shortcuts sheet** — shipped the smallest genuinely-safe
      slice rather than the item's full original wish list. `?` opens a new `KeyboardShortcutsSheet`
      (built on the shared `Modal`) listing every shortcut that actually exists: the pre-existing
      Ctrl/Cmd+K (never documented anywhere before this), a new ←/→ swipe-navigation shortcut, `Esc`
      to close the open panel, and `?` itself. Both new global handlers (`?` in `App.tsx`, ←/→ in
      `ChatWindow.tsx`) guard against firing while focus is in an `INPUT`/`TEXTAREA`/
      `contentEditable` element, since both keys are ordinary typing characters/navigation keys, not
      exotic combos. `Esc`-to-close is one `useEffect` added to `Modal.tsx` itself, so every one of
      the dozen-plus panels built on that shared shell gets it for free, not just new ones.
      **Deliberately cut real functionality, not just scope, out of the original wish list**:
      "send" needs no shortcut (Enter already sends); "new chat" and "toggle VN" were left out
      rather than bound to something arbitrary, since every available key was already either a
      reserved OS/browser combo or an ordinary typing character; "regenerate" was left out for a
      sharper reason — arrow-key swipe deliberately never triggers `swipe()`'s own "generate a
      brand-new swipe" branch at the last index (see `useChatSession.ts`), since silently kicking
      off a real generation from what reads as a passive browsing gesture would be a surprising,
      easy-to-trigger-by-accident side effect, not a shortcut anyone actually asked for — the same
      reasoning would apply to a bare "regenerate" key. Verified live: `?` opens the sheet with the
      correct four rows, `Esc` closes it, and dispatching an arrow key at a focused `<textarea>`
      correctly produces no swipe/network activity, confirming the typing guard holds.
- [ ] **A "what these do" explainer for the mode toggles** — VN mode, `autoTrackRelationship`,
      `autoSuggestChoices`, `autoDetectTasks`, difficulty: a new user has no way to know which of
      these belong to "I want plain assistant chat" vs "I want a dating sim." Ties directly into
      section 10e's **world templates**, which is really the structural fix — pull that item's
      priority up, since it's the thing that lets a plain-RP world not carry the whole section-10
      mechanic surface.

## 14. Competitive parity — SillyTavern / RisuAI / Agnai

This app already matches or beats SillyTavern on several axes a dating-sim/VN user cares about: VN
mode is on-by-default and actually wired to mood/scene tags, the dating-sim mechanics and per-world
economy have no ST equivalent, the world clock/weather/schedule simulation is real, and full
one-file backup/restore is cleaner than ST's scattered data dirs. The items below are things a
user arriving from ST, RisuAI, or Agnai will immediately reach for and not find. Sources:
SillyTavern docs/releases, RisuAI (CCv3, CBS/trigger system, regex scripts), Agnai (multi-user).

- [x] **Author's Note / per-chat injected note** — done. `Chat.authorNote?: { text, position:
      'before_char' | 'after_char' | 'at_depth', depth }` (`types.ts`), edited from a new
      `NotebookPen` toolbar button → `AuthorNotePanel.tsx` (radio for the three positions, a 0-8
      depth slider shown only for `at_depth`, "Clear note" for removal). `builder.ts` gained a
      matching `authorNote` input: `before_char`/`after_char` fold into the fixed identity region
      (before the character block / after the examples), `at_depth` is spliced into the trimmed
      history as its own line `depth` turns up from the latest (depth 0 = immediately before the
      generation cue). The note is macro-substituted (`{{char}}`/`{{user}}`) like every other text
      field, counts against the context budget, and reaches the Prompt Inspector automatically
      since `previewPrompt` runs the same `buildCurrentPrompt` path. Cleared by sending an explicit
      `authorNote: null` (not `undefined`) — the `JSON.stringify`-drops-`undefined` guard, same as
      `activeEvent` (changelog #28). 6 new `builder.test.ts` cases (each position's placement, the
      at-depth insertion point, blank/unset no-op, budget accounting); 167 tests green, typecheck +
      production build clean; verified live end-to-end against the seeded Sumire chat (set a note,
      confirmed it in the assembled prompt at the right spot via the Prompt Inspector, confirmed it
      persisted across a reload and that "Clear note" round-trips to `null`).
      **Deliberately deferred** (noted, not silently dropped): `everyNTurns` (inject only every N
      turns — turn-count semantics get fuzzy with swipes/regen, wanted the simple version proven
      first), and per-character / per-world *default* notes (a small additive follow-up once the
      chat-level one has been used).
- [x] **Regex / find-and-replace scripts on model output** — done. `Settings.regexScripts:
      RegexScript[]` (`{ id, name, find, replace, flags?, target: 'display' | 'prompt' | 'both',
      enabled }`, `types.ts`), edited from a "Regex scripts" section in Settings → Generation
      (`RegexScriptsSection.tsx`, a `ListEditor` of rules; a non-compiling pattern is flagged inline
      and skipped, never thrown). `src/lib/text/regexScripts.ts`'s `applyRegexScripts(text,
      scripts, target)` is the one pure entry point (12 tests: backrefs, `\n` unescaping, target
      filtering, invalid-pattern skip, flag handling, chaining). **Display** target runs in
      `renderMessageText` (`messageText.tsx`) — so the chat list, VN dialogue box, and the HTML
      transcript export all pick it up — **prompt** target runs in `builder.ts`'s `renderTurn` per
      history turn, so it reaches the Prompt Inspector for free. The stored message is never
      touched, so a rule is fully reversible by disabling it (the `'stored'` target the roadmap
      floated was dropped for that reason). Verified live: a `WIDGET → gizmo` "both" rule showed
      "gizmo" in the rendered greeting AND in the assembled prompt via the Prompt Inspector.
      Per-character/per-world scoping stays a later refinement.
- [x] **Prompt/context template manager** — in ST the order, on/off state, and content of every
      prompt section is a drag-to-reorder editable list. Here, all three parts of the rough shape
      this bullet originally sketched are done, with one deliberate, documented scope cut (below).
      - **(a) Duplicate + edit + save, mirroring the sampler-preset UI** — done.
        `instructTemplatesApi`/`instruct_templates` table (server/client, same shape as
        presets/themes: list/create/update/delete) plus `resolveInstructTemplate(id, custom[])`
        (`instructTemplates.ts`), which checks a user's saved custom templates before falling back
        to the 5 builtins — used everywhere `getInstructTemplate` used to be, so a custom template
        resolves correctly wherever a builtin id would have. `InstructTemplateSection.tsx`
        (Settings → Generation) replaces the old plain builtin-only `<select>`: a dropdown picks
        the active global default (builtin or custom), "Duplicate active template into editor
        below" copies its 8 fields (prefixes/suffixes/stop sequences/`namesInPrompt`) into an
        editable form, and "Save as new template" persists it and switches to it immediately —
        exactly the sampler-preset "Save current" pattern, just with a duplicate-first step since
        an instruct template has no single "live" object the way `sampler` does. Saved custom
        templates get Use/Edit a copy/Delete rows, same as the Presets list.
      - **(b) `Character.instructTemplateId?` override** — done. A character can pin a specific
        instruct format (builtin or custom) regardless of the global default — useful for a
        character always run against one particular model/format. Added to `CharacterEditor`'s
        Advanced tab, next to the existing prompt-override fields; `useChatSession.ts` resolves
        `character?.instructTemplateId || instructTemplateId` (character wins, empty/unset falls
        back to global), same precedence style as the voice override. Uses the same
        `null`-not-`undefined` clearing convention as every other optional character field.
        Deliberately **not** added to `.rppack.json` — a custom template id is only meaningful on
        the install that created it, and bundling a dangling reference into a shared pack would be
        worse than just leaving the field unset for the importer to set themselves.
      - **(c) Section enable-flags as data** — done. `builder.ts` names each independently-computed
        fixed section (`PromptSectionId`: system/summary/world/description/participants/persona/
        examples) and a new `PromptBuildInput.promptSections?: Partial<Record<PromptSectionId,
        boolean>>` gates each one's inclusion — an unset entry defaults to on
        (`DEFAULT_PROMPT_SECTIONS`), so every existing caller keeps today's always-on behavior
        unchanged. Replaces `includeExamples`, a same-shaped flag that existed on the builder
        already but was dead — nothing ever set it. `useSettingsStore.promptSections` (global,
        persisted) is the one real caller, threaded through `useChatSession.ts`'s
        `buildCurrentPrompt`; a new `PromptSectionsSection.tsx` (Settings → Generation, next to the
        instruct template editor) exposes all 7 as `Toggle`s. **Deliberately not done: reordering.**
        Full drag-to-reorder, ST-style, isn't exposed — several of these sections are
        order-coupled to world-info before/after placement and the Author's Note's own
        before_char/at_depth/after_char position in ways a flat list would silently break (moving
        "description" past "world" would, for instance, desync from where `worldBefore`/
        `worldAfter` actually land relative to it). Enable/disable is safe to expose without
        touching that structure; reordering would need those interactions redesigned first, a
        genuinely separate, larger effort. World-info entry position and the Author's Note's own
        position control stay exactly as they are — both already have finer-grained placement
        control than a single section-level flag would give them anyway.
        6 new tests (`builder.test.ts`) — default-on behavior, each section's disable in isolation,
        and disabling one leaves the others untouched. **Verified live**: toggled off "World /
        setting description" in Settings → Generation, opened the seeded Sumire chat's Prompt
        Inspector, and confirmed the world block's two distinctive phrases (`"cherry-blossom-lined
        quads"` from the world's description, `"grounded and present-day"` from its rules) were
        both absent from the exact assembled prompt while unrelated content — the character's own
        profile mentioning the same campus by name, prior chat history — correctly still appeared;
        re-enabled it and confirmed the setting round-tripped through `localStorage`.
      5 new tests (`instructTemplates.test.ts`) covering builtin/custom resolution and the unknown-id
      fallback. Verified live end-to-end: duplicated ChatML, edited its system prefix, saved it as
      "My ChatML Variant" (appeared as the active template immediately), set it as a per-character
      override on the seeded Sumire, confirmed both persisted via a fresh fetch, and confirmed
      `template` (the resolved object) is genuinely threaded into `buildCurrentPrompt` and the
      generation call's merged stop-sequence list, not just computed and discarded.
- [ ] **World Info depth ST/RisuAI still have that we don't**:
      - ~~**sticky / cooldown / delay**~~ — done (sticky/cooldown in #94, `delay` in #95). The
        blocker (no stable per-entry key across this app's merged lorebook sources) was solved with
        `Lorebook.sourceKey`, stamped by `useChatSession` as it assembles the list;
        `Chat.worldInfoState` holds the per-entry `{activeUntil, blockedUntil, activeAt}`
        bookkeeping. `delay` (an entry can't fire until the chat has N messages) needs no persisted
        state, just the same threaded turn counter, and applies to every activation mode. The
        activation engine now covers SillyTavern's full set.
      - ~~**injection at a chat depth**~~ — done. `LorebookEntry.position` gained `'at_depth'`
        alongside `before_char`/`after_char`, with its own `depth` field (same convention as
        `AuthorNote.depth`) — a new "At depth" option in `LorebookEditor`'s Position select, with a
        Depth number field that only shows once it's picked. `builder.ts`'s injection pass, previously
        hand-built for the one fixed Author's Note, is now generalized to any number of depth-anchored
        items: each is spliced in at its own `includedTurns.length - depth` position, processed
        farthest-back first so a shallower item's "distance from the end" is computed against the
        array as the deeper ones have already grown it — the same way a person layering several
        depth-anchored notes by hand would reason about their relative positions. 4 new
        `builder.test.ts` cases (depth 0, depth 1, a lorebook entry layered against the Author's Note
        at a different depth, token-budget accounting). Verified live: added a temporary "always" +
        "at depth" (depth 2) entry to a book already scoped to the seeded Sumire chat, confirmed via
        the Prompt Inspector it activated (showed in "World info activated") and landed exactly once,
        two messages up from the latest, ahead of the relationship-description block — not in the
        fixed identity region above the transcript — then removed the test entry. 244 tests green,
        typecheck + build clean.
      - ~~**global-book binding UI**~~ — done. `WorldInfoBook` gained `boundCharacterIds` /
        `boundWorldIds` alongside the pre-existing (UI-less) `boundChatIds`; a book with no
        bindings at all is still global (every book that predates this stays exactly as it was).
        `src/lib/worldinfo/scope.ts` (`isGlobalBook` / `bookAppliesToChat`, 7 tests) is the one
        place the "does this book apply here" question is answered — `useChatSession.ts`'s book
        filter now calls it with the chat's id, primary character id, and that character's world
        id. A new `BookScopePicker` ("Available in" — character/world chips, "Make global" reset)
        sits in a rebuilt `WorldInfoView`, and each book row shows its scope ("Every chat" /
        "Sumire, +1"). Server-side `normalizeIdArray` dedupes/validates the three arrays on
        POST/PUT. Chat-level binding stays data-only (a chat is too transient to be worth a
        picker). Verified live: scoped the seeded "Campus Life" book to Sumire, confirmed the PUT
        persisted `boundCharacterIds`, confirmed via the Prompt Inspector that its entries still
        activate in a Sumire chat; negative case (a non-matching character) is covered by the unit
        tests. 174 tests green, typecheck + build clean.
      - ~~**weighted inclusion groups**~~ — done. New `LorebookEntry.groupWeight` — if any member of
        a group sets it, the winner is a weighted random draw across the whole group (an unset
        weight on another member defaults to 1) instead of the old deterministic "highest
        `insertion_order` wins" rule, which stays the default behavior for every group that never
        sets a weight (existing books are completely unaffected). A new "Weight" `NumberField` in
        `LorebookEditor` appears next to "Inclusion group" only once a group name is set, with an
        "order wins" placeholder making the fallback behavior visible rather than a silent default.
        7 new `activation.test.ts` cases, mirroring the existing `probability` tests' own
        deterministic-boundary style (weight 0 vs. a positive peer, run N times) rather than
        asserting on a single random draw. Verified live against the seeded "Campus Life" book's
        existing `weather-mood` group (`clear, sunny` vs. `rain, storm`): set a weight, confirmed
        via a direct API fetch it persisted, then cleared it again and confirmed the key was
        removed entirely rather than left as a stray `0`/`undefined` — restoring the seeded demo
        content to exactly its original deterministic behavior. 248 tests green, typecheck + build
        clean.
- [x] **Read CCv3 character cards** — done. `normalizeCardJson` already read a V3 card's text
      fields (it reads `data.*` and never checked `spec_version`); new here is `extractCardAssets`
      (`cardSpec.ts`, 10 tests) which pulls the usable parts of a V3 `data.assets` array —
      `{ type, uri, name, ext }` per asset — into our shape: an `icon` asset becomes the portrait,
      `emotion` assets become expression sprites keyed by our expression id (with ~30 common
      aliases mapped — `joy → happy`, `fear → scared`, … — and anything unrecognised kept as a
      custom expression so it still gets an editor slot). `importCharacterFile` returns the extra
      `sprites`/`customExpressions`; `CharacterEditor.applyImport` merges them (keeping anything
      already uploaded over the import) and toasts how many landed. `ccdefault:` and `embeded://`
      URIs are skipped (neither resolves from a bare card — the former is "use the card's own
      image", already handled for PNG imports; the latter needs the CHARX zip we don't read), and
      only `data:` / `https:` art is taken (`http:` skipped as a tracking vector). `background` /
      `user_icon` assets are ignored — a character import has no world to put a background on.
      Verified live: imported a hand-built V3 JSON with `icon` + `happy` + `joy` + `Mischievous` +
      a `ccdefault:` `sad` + a `background` asset; the portrait and the Happy slot (deduped from
      happy+joy) filled, "Mischievous" appeared as a new custom expression, and the `ccdefault:`
      and `background` assets were correctly ignored. **Still open** (deliberately): reading a
      `.charx` (zip) container's `embeded://` assets, and writing V3 on export (`.rppack.json`
      already covers our own round-trip).
- [x] **Quick Replies bar** — a user-configurable row of buttons that send a templated message
      verbatim, exactly as if typed and sent by hand. New `QuickReply` type (`types.ts`), a
      `quickReplies` array in `useSettingsStore` (global, not per-chat/per-character — a fixed
      utility toolbar makes sense everywhere, unlike authored content tied to one world), a
      `QuickRepliesSection` settings panel (Settings → Generation, `ListEditor` over label+message
      pairs) seeded with three starters ("Look around," "Let time pass," "Change the subject") that
      a returning user's own edits/deletions are never overwritten by. `QuickReplyBar.tsx` renders
      the row in both `ChatWindow` layouts and inside `VNStage`'s glass panel, reusing `ChoiceList`'s
      exact chip shape/variant convention for visual consistency. Deliberately shown only when the
      AI-suggested `ChoiceList` isn't (`choiceListNode(variant) || quickReplyNode(variant)` in
      `ChatWindow.tsx`) so at most one chip row ever competes for the same strip above the composer,
      rather than stacking two rows of pills. Clicking one calls the same `sendUserMessage` path as
      typing and hitting Send — no new send mechanism. Verified live: turned off "Suggest choices"
      to isolate it, confirmed the three default buttons render with correct label/message, clicked
      "Look around" and confirmed `*takes a moment to look around and take in the surroundings*`
      was sent as the user's own message and got a real in-character scene-description reply back;
      confirmed the Settings panel's add/edit/remove round-trips. Not done: the roadmap's own
      "give a gift" example action — that's already its own dedicated Bag/gift-shop flow (section
      2), a quick-reply button sending plain text isn't the right shape for it. Overlaps with
      section 12's plugin API but doesn't need it, per this item's original scoping.
- [x] **Trigger / event system** (RisuAI's CBS + triggers) — shipped as `src/lib/world/triggers.ts` + a Worlds -> Dating sim -> Rules editor; see section 2's entry for the design and what was deliberately left out. Original note kept below for context.
- [~] **(original wording)** — an author-facing "when X, then Y"
      layer: on a keyword, on a stat crossing a threshold, on a scene flag, on day-advance → set a
      variable, swap the background, fire a lorebook entry, queue a message. We already produce all
      the events (`relationship_events`, `sceneFlags`, the world clock); there's just no way for an
      author to hang behavior off them without editing code. Large; pairs with section 12's plugin
      hooks and 10f's world tick — worth designing them together.
- [~] **Mobile / responsive layout** — first slice: the core chat experience, not every editor
      screen (a full pass is bigger than one session). `Sidebar.tsx` is a bottom-fixed icon bar
      under `md`, the original vertical rail at `md` and up — `expanded`/collapse stays a
      desktop-only concept, mobile is always icon-only. `ChatsPanel`/`ChatWindow` no longer sit
      permanently side by side below `md`: `ChatSurface` (`App.tsx`) tracks a local
      `mobileListOpen` toggle that shows one full-width at a time, with a new `ChatWindow`/`VNStage`
      `onBack` prop rendering a back arrow (chrome header, and the VN glass toolbar pill) to return
      to the list — untouched at `md` and up, where both always render side by side regardless.
      `ChatsPanel`'s own collapsed mini-rail (a desktop preference for saving width next to a wide
      `ChatWindow`) doesn't make sense on a phone with no width to spare in the first place, so it's
      now `hidden md:flex`, with the full list forced instead via a `mobileOnly` render path —
      caught live: without this, a desktop `collapsed` preference left mobile showing a useless
      w-14 icon strip and a mostly-blank screen.
      **Two real overflow bugs found and fixed via live measurement, not just visual inspection**
      (`getBoundingClientRect`, not trusting a screenshot that can silently clip): the VN mode
      top-right glass toolbar pill (9 action icons + Log, all in one row) measured 453px wide
      against a 375px viewport — `right-4` positioning meant it overflowed *left*, off-screen,
      invisibly; the ordinary chat header's icon toolbar had the exact same problem, just next to a
      shrinking title instead of visibly breaking. Both fixed with a capped `max-w` +
      `overflow-x-auto` rather than a real "what's essential on mobile" icon-set redesign, which is
      a bigger, more opinionated follow-up. Applying the same live-measurement check to
      `SettingsView.tsx`'s 5-tab strip (`Connection/Appearance/Generation/Voice/Data`) found a
      worse version of the same bug: `overflow-x: visible` with no scroll affordance at all meant
      Voice and Data were completely unreachable on mobile, not just tight — fixed with the same
      `overflow-x-auto` pattern; `EditorShell.tsx`'s own tab strip (Character/World editors) already
      had it, confirmed by checking rather than assuming.
      **Deliberately not done in this slice**: every other view (Characters/Worlds/Personas/World
      Info/Gallery/settings sub-panels) gets responsive layout "for free" from the App-level
      Sidebar/ChatsPanel fix, verified not to overflow, but wasn't individually redesigned for
      touch/small-screen ergonomics; a real "what's essential in the mobile toolbar" icon audit,
      mentioned above twice, stays open; touch-target sizing was verified adequate for the bottom
      nav (44px) but not audited app-wide. Verified live end-to-end at a 375×812 viewport: chat
      list ↔ chat window navigation via the back button in both VN and ordinary modes, bottom nav
      switching between every top-level view, zero horizontal page overflow measured directly
      (`document.documentElement.scrollWidth === innerWidth`) after each fix, and a full-desktop
      regression check afterward confirming the rail/collapsed-panel/toolbar all render exactly as
      before at desktop width.
      **Two more real bugs found and fixed in a later pass**, this time triggered by VN-mode
      content tall enough that the earlier slice's test scenarios never happened to hit it:
      (1) A live playthrough at 375×812 in VN mode measured the message composer's own `<textarea>`
      sitting at `top: 833px` on an 812px-tall viewport — completely below the fold, unreachable,
      not just cramped. Root cause was the exact flexbox `min-height: auto` bug class already fixed
      once for the VN sprite itself (section 1), one level higher up the tree this time:
      `App.tsx`'s `<div className="flex flex-1 min-w-0 pb-14 md:pb-0">` (the view-content wrapper)
      measured 951px tall inside its own 812px-tall flex parent, refusing to shrink because nothing
      in the chain had `min-h-0`. Fixed with `min-h-0` on that wrapper — confirmed live afterward
      that the composer's full `getBoundingClientRect()` now sits inside the viewport. Also capped
      `VNStage`'s choice-list row at `max-h-[15vh] overflow-y-auto` (the same "capped rather than
      left to grow" treatment its own dialogue box already had) as a second, independent guard, so
      a long inclusion group or several quick-replies wrapping to multiple lines can't reopen the
      same failure mode even if some future change loses the `min-h-0` fix.
      (2) The ordinary (non-VN) chat header's title block measured only 119px wide at 375px — the
      icon toolbar's own `shrink-0` wrapper directly determines how much is left for the title, and
      its existing 45vw mobile cap (added for a different reason — keeping the toolbar itself from
      overflowing) still left too little: the character's name truncated to a single letter, and
      "near strangers • 6" wrapped across two lines, visibly inflating the header. Tightened the
      toolbar's mobile cap to 30vw (still scrolls to reach every icon, just shows fewer before
      scrolling) and made the warmth-stage label `truncate` on one line instead of wrap — measured
      the title block's width go from 119px to 175.5px live, name and stage label both render
      correctly, header height dropped from 114px to 104px. Both fixes verified with zero
      horizontal overflow at 375px and a full desktop-width regression check confirming the header
      and VN panel are unchanged there.
      **Editor/settings ergonomics pass (#96)** closes most of what this item deferred: the
      editor and Settings tab strips (7 and 5 tabs, both previously an unlabelled horizontal
      scroll) now render as a native `<select>` under `sm` and the visible strip at `sm`+;
      `EditorShell`/`ViewShell`/`Modal`/`Section` padding is `p-4 sm:p-*` instead of a flat `p-6`/`p-7`;
      every shared field control is `text-base sm:text-sm` (16px on mobile stops iOS Safari
      zooming the page on focus) with a taller mobile tap target; and the side-by-side
      text-input pairs in `CharacterEditor` (social connections, relationship starters, weather
      loves/hates, schedule rows) stack to one column under `sm`.
      **Mobile toolbar + touch-target pass (#97)** closes the rest: `ChatToolbar` gained a
      `priority: 'primary-desktop'` tier (icon on `sm`+, folds into the "•••" menu on a phone) —
      the date/event and objective actions use it, so the mobile chat toolbar is just Relationship
      + "•••" (+ Back and Log in VN mode), rendered purely by breakpoint with no JS media query.
      VNStage's two top overlays (the Bond HUD on the left, the toolbar on the right) were
      independent `absolute` elements that overlapped at 375px — the HUD literally painted over the
      back button; now one flex row where the HUD truncates and the toolbar never shrinks, and the
      VN "Log" button is icon-only under `sm`. Shared `Button` is `py-2.5 sm:py-1.5` (~40px tap
      target on touch, back to 32px on desktop). Also fixed a real pre-existing bug found here:
      `NewChatDialog` was mounted inside `ChatsPanel`'s `hidden md:flex` collapsed rail, so with a
      persisted `chatsPanelCollapsed` preference the dialog was `display:none` and completely
      unopenable on a phone — moved to a sibling of both panel variants. `NewChatDialog` also now
      uses the shared `Modal`'s `scrollable` mode and 16px-on-mobile inputs.
- [~] **Chat management basics** — rename, duplicate, one-click "new chat, same character &
      persona," and pin/favorite (`Chat.pinned`, shipped separately — see section 9's #119) are all
      done; folders/tags stay open (below). `ChatsPanel.tsx` gained a
      per-row `MoreHorizontal` menu (a lightweight inline popover, click-outside-to-close via the
      same backdrop technique `Modal`/`CommandPalette` already use — no new shared component,
      since nothing else needs a generic dropdown yet) with four actions:
      - **Rename** — the row's title becomes an inline `<input>` in place (no separate dialog),
        committed on Enter/blur, cancelled on Escape. `chatsApi.update(id, { title })`; the title
        was frozen to the character's name at creation until now.
      - **Duplicate (full copy)** — reuses `chatsApi.fork(id)` **with no `messageId`**, which the
        existing fork endpoint (section 4) already treats as "clone the whole chat" when the
        cutoff is omitted (`server/app.ts`'s fork route: `cutoff = allMessages.length` when
        `req.body.messageId` is absent) — history, relationship stats, events, and facts all
        clone, exactly what "duplicate" means. No new server code at all; this is UI over an
        already-shipped, already-tested mechanism. The copy lands with `parentChatId` set, same as
        any fork, which doubles as a free "jump back to the original" link.
      - **New chat, same character & persona** — genuinely new: creates a *fresh* chat (0
        affection, no history) reusing the row's `characterId`/`personaId`. Extracted the chat-
        creation logic `NewChatDialog.tsx` already had into a shared `src/lib/chat/createChat.ts`
        (`createChat()` + a pure `availableGreetings()` helper, 6 new unit tests) rather than
        duplicating it a second time — `NewChatDialog` itself was refactored to call the same
        function, so the starting-state fields (gift coins, starting inventory, assist overrides,
        warmth-derived stage) can't drift between the picker-flow path and this one-click path.
      - **Delete** — found live while scoping this item: `DELETE /api/chats/:id` (section 4) has
        existed since chat deletion was first wired up, but there was **no UI anywhere in the app
        that could call it** — not mentioned in this bullet's original wording, but about as basic
        as "chat management" gets, so added here rather than filed as a separate gap. Behind a
        `confirm()`; if the deleted chat was the active one, clears `activeChatId` too (via
        widening `ChatsPanel`'s `onSelect` to accept `null`, matching `ChatSurface`'s own prop
        shape in `App.tsx`) — otherwise the app would keep pointing at a chat that no longer
        exists (`ChatWindow` degrades gracefully to its empty state, but the sidebar would show
        nothing selected forever). **Since made recoverable — see the trash entry (#115) below.**
      **Verified live end-to-end**, deliberately against disposable test data rather than the
      real seeded Sumire chats (created a throwaway "TestBot" character + chat via the actual
      `NewChatDialog` UI, not a shortcut): renamed it and confirmed the new title via a fresh
      `GET /api/chats`; duplicated it and confirmed the copy's messages, `parentChatId`, and title
      suffix; ran "new chat, same character" and confirmed the result had 0 affection, no
      `parentChatId`, the same `personaId`, the cloned greeting message, and that `activeChatId`
      genuinely navigated to it; deleted all three test chats plus the test character through the
      same UI (confirmed `activeChatId` cleared on the active one) and confirmed via a final
      `GET /api/chats`/`GET /api/characters` that the two real Sumire chats/characters — including
      exact `affection`/`relationshipStats`/`sceneFlags` values — were untouched throughout.
      **Deliberately not done**: chat folders/tags/pinned-chats-list — a real, separate authoring
      surface (its own UI for creating/assigning tags, not a quick addition to this row menu), and
      AI Dungeon's Adventure-model framing (title/tags/settings as one coherent per-chat settings
      object) is a bigger reference shape worth its own pass once tags exist to hang it on.
- [x] **Deleted chats are recoverable — a real trash, not just a confirm dialog** (#115). Prompted
      by an actual incident: verifying #114 above involved creating and deleting several throwaway
      test chats, and a dev-server crash (see the two hardening fixes below) during that same
      session left the timeline genuinely unclear enough that a chat with real content couldn't be
      confidently ruled out as collateral. It turned out to be an empty one, but "was that the right
      one?" should never be a question a hard, cascading, un-undoable delete can even raise.
      - **Soft delete, not gone** — `DELETE /api/chats/:id` now sets `Chat.deletedAt` instead of
        cascading immediately; `GET /api/chats` filters trashed chats out, `GET /api/chats/trash`
        (registered before `/api/chats/:id` — same literal-vs-`:id` ordering rule as
        `/api/messages/search`) returns only them, newest-deleted first. `POST /:id/restore` clears
        the field. The actual cascading delete (messages, objectives, relationship events, facts,
        un-parenting any fork) is now `purgeChat()`, one function reused by the new
        `DELETE /:id/purge` route, a 30-day retention sweep run once at server startup
        (`purgeExpiredTrash`), and character deletion's own chat cascade (previously its own copy of
        the same four loops, now the one shared implementation).
      - **`TrashPanel.tsx`** — restore or "delete forever" (its own confirmation, `confirmDialog`)
        per row. Reachable from `ChatsPanel`'s sidebar footer, and — this is the part the incident
        actually exposed — from `WelcomeView` too: that screen takes over full-bleed with no sidebar
        at all once `chats.length === 0`, exactly the state deleting your only/last chat leaves you
        in, so without a link there too the trash it just went into would've been unreachable from
        the one place it would matter most. Both show a small "N in the trash" affordance only when
        the trash is non-empty; unlike this codebase's other stakes-free per-chat mechanics, this
        one is deliberately not framed narratively (no VN copy, this is a data-safety page).
      - **Two independent dev-environment hardening fixes**, found live while chasing what actually
        happened during the incident, not the feature itself: (1) `vite.config.ts`'s
        `presets/`-folder watch-exclusion (already noted as "resolved" once before) still crashed
        with `EBUSY` on Windows — the bare glob wasn't reliably matching backslash paths, fixed by
        adding the resolved absolute path alongside it. (2) A separate, previously-undiagnosed
        `Error: database is locked` on `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL` at `server/db.ts`'s startup —
        `tsx watch` restarting the server on every source save can beat Windows to fully releasing
        the previous process's file lock, and losing that race crashed the process outright with no
        auto-recovery. Fixed with `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000` as the connection's very first
        statement (SQLite's own built-in "retry quietly instead of failing instantly" mechanism,
        the standard fix for exactly this transient-contention shape of "locked"). Reproduced
        directly — three server-file saves fired within 300ms of each other reliably crashed the
        server before this fix and reliably didn't after.
      No new client-side tests (server routes; this codebase's established pattern is live
      verification for those, not a server-side test harness). **Verified live end-to-end**: soft-
      deleted a throwaway chat through the real UI, confirmed the updated confirm-dialog copy,
      confirmed it vanished from the main list and `WelcomeView`'s "N in the trash" link appeared;
      restored it through `TrashPanel` and landed straight back in the conversation; deleted it
      again and purged it for real, confirmed via direct API calls that it's gone from both the
      active list and the trash. Separately stress-tested the SQLite fix with three rapid
      server-file saves, which crashed reliably before and came up clean every time after.
- [x] **Generation HUD** — tokens/sec, time-to-first-token, and a context-fill gauge during and
      after generation, distinct from `showTokenCounts`' per-message-after-the-fact count. New
      `GenerationStats` (`useChatSession.ts`) and `GenerationHud.tsx`, gated behind a
      `showGenerationHud` setting (Settings → Appearance, next to `showTokenCounts`, default on).
      **Tried KoboldCpp's own `/api/extra/perf` first and abandoned it after a real live-caught
      bug**: that endpoint reports the server's single most recent generation of *any* kind, so with
      post-reply assists (relationship scoring, choice suggestions) sharing the same server, its
      numbers can describe an unrelated background call instead of the reply the HUD is showing —
      one live run surfaced a nonsensical "300.21s to first token" this way, immediately visible as
      wrong (the same server's own `/api/extra/perf` polled directly showed ~7s at the time).
      Rebuilt entirely client-side instead, timed from each round's own SSE stream (`runGeneration`
      in `useChatSession.ts`) — correct by construction since it can only ever measure tokens that
      arrived on this exact request. Also fixed `PerfInfo`'s type (`api/types.ts`) along the way:
      its original fields (`last_process`/`last_eval`/`last_seconds`) never matched a real
      KoboldCpp response at all — dead code that had simply never been called until this pass
      exercised it, now corrected to the real shape (`last_process_time`/`last_eval_speed`/etc.,
      confirmed via a direct `curl` against the live server) even though the HUD itself no longer
      uses it. Numbers update live on every token while streaming (labeled "streaming…"), then do
      one final recompute over the round's full duration when it lands. Verified live end-to-end
      across a reply that ran three auto-continue rounds: watched tok/s and context-fill climb
      sensibly through all three, confirmed the "streaming…" label clears and the number stops
      moving once generation actually finishes, and spot-checked the final reading (14.9 tok/s)
      against a direct `curl` of `/api/extra/perf` moments later (16.4 eval speed) — same ballpark,
      not a bit-for-bit match, since that endpoint's own "last" figure had almost certainly already
      moved on to the post-reply assist calls that fire right after a reply lands — exactly the
      attribution problem that ruled it out as this HUD's source of truth in the first place.
- [x] **Multiple chat-completion backends** — shipped as #121 (section 8's own item) — an ST/Risu
      user on a hosted model (Claude via OpenRouter, Gemini via OpenRouter, OpenAI directly) can now
      point this app at it from Settings → Connection instead of needing a local KoboldCpp server.

## 15. Competitive ideas — AI Dungeon

Added from a user-supplied feature analysis of [aidungeon.com](https://aidungeon.com), read in full
and cross-checked against what's already here rather than transcribed. AI Dungeon is a genuinely
different kind of product from this app: a sandbox open-world AI-RPG platform built around
publishing, discovery, and a shared community library, with an account/cloud-save layer this app
deliberately doesn't have (see the Privacy section of the README — no accounts, no cloud, nothing
leaves the machine except calls to KoboldCpp and an optional TTS/STT provider). Most of its
platform-facing surface (Discover/Trending, Scenario/Adventure publishing with
Draft/Unlisted/Published visibility, content ratings for public browsing, a Credits/Scales
currency balancing paid inference against free usage, an "Improve the AI" telemetry/dataset-
opt-in) doesn't transfer at all and isn't being pursued — it exists to solve problems (a paid
hosted-inference business, a public content marketplace) this app doesn't have. True networked
multiplayer (join codes, inviting/kicking/blocking other *people* in one shared adventure) is the
same story: it would need an accounts-and-sync layer that contradicts "everything stays on this
machine" at the architecture level, not just a missing feature — a local same-device pass-and-play
mode is a different, much smaller ask if it's ever wanted, but isn't scoped here. What's below is
the subset that's actually a good fit for a local-first, single-user, character-centric app.

- [ ] **User-authored scripting, scoped to one character or world**: AI Dungeon's strongest and
      most novel idea for this app to learn from. A Scenario can carry JavaScript across four
      hook points (Library — shared helpers/state; Input — rewrite what the player typed before
      it's interpreted; Context — rewrite what's about to be sent to the model; Output — rewrite
      what the model produced) with persistent state and a Script Test sandbox (feed sample input,
      inspect returned text/logs/updated state before it ever runs for real). Community scripts
      reportedly cover dice rolls, custom stat systems, relationship tracking, random events, and
      auto-populated Story Cards — i.e. creators building their *own* game mechanics on top of the
      narrative engine instead of waiting for the app to ship them. This is a natural, larger
      extension of this app's own founding principle (see section 10's intro: "the model plays the
      character, deterministic code runs the world") — right now only the *app's* code gets to be
      that deterministic layer; this would let a *creator* be it too, for their own character or
      world, without forking the app. The smallest real version of this already exists and ships
      today: regex scripts (`src/lib/text/regexScripts.ts`) are exactly an Output-only hook with no
      state and a fixed transform shape (find/replace). A real scripting layer is the general case
      of that. **Distinct from section 12's "plugin/extension API"** — that one is an app-level
      surface for extending the whole app (new UI panels, app-wide hooks) aimed at someone
      comfortable shipping a mod; this would be scenario-level, shipped *inside* one character or
      world's own data, closer to "a formula in a spreadsheet" than "a browser extension."
      Rough shape, smallest first, and each step needs a real sandboxing answer before it ships (a
      Web Worker with no `fetch`/DOM access, or a restricted interpreter — arbitrary JS touching a
      local Express server and SQLite database is a real risk, not a formality, even single-user):
      (a) an Output-only hook — pure `(text, state) => { text, state }`, run after generation,
      before the message is stored, no network/DOM access, with a test sandbox mirroring AI
      Dungeon's; (b) persistent per-character/world script state, surfaced somewhere read-only
      (the eventual director/debug view in section 12 is the natural home); (c) Input and Context
      hooks once (a) and (b) have actually been used and the risk profile is better understood.
- [ ] **Scenario-style starting templates with fill-in-the-blank placeholders**: a step beyond the
      world templates just shipped (10e) and `Character.relationshipStarters[]` — a reusable
      starting package (a world, its bound character(s), an opening premise, optionally a persona
      nudge) that asks the player a few short questions when starting a chat from it ("Your
      character's name?", "How do you know each other?") and substitutes the answers into the
      opening, the same idea as AI Dungeon's Scenario placeholders. Mad-libs-simple, but it turns
      "recreate the same opening for a new save" from manual re-entry into picking a template and
      filling a couple of blanks — worth doing once world templates (10e) have seen enough real use
      to know what actually varies between starts of the same world.
- [ ] **Explicit Do / Say / Narrate input modes**: AI Dungeon disambiguates a turn's *kind* (action,
      dialogue, direct narration) instead of leaving it to the model to infer from punctuation
      alone. This app already leans on a convention for the same distinction post-hoc
      (`*action*`/"dialogue" segment parsing, `src/lib/text/messageSegments.ts`) but nothing marks
      *input* this way before it's sent. A small composer affordance — a mode chip (Do/Say/Narrate)
      next to the existing impersonate toggle, folded into the turn as a light prefix hint rather
      than a new field — could reduce ambiguity for a less-experienced user typing plain text,
      worth prototyping small before committing to it as a permanent control.
- [ ] **On-demand in-chat scene snapshot generation**: distinct from section 11's "generate into an
      editor slot" tools (portrait/sprite/CG/background authoring) — AI Dungeon's **See** action
      generates an image of *what's happening right now* directly in the transcript, not something
      saved into a persistent character/world slot. Once section 11's image-generation backend
      abstraction exists, a chat-level "snapshot this moment" action reusing the same provider is a
      small addition on top, not a separate integration.
- [x] **Raw vs. processed model output toggle**: the Prompt Inspector already showed the exact text
      *sent* to the model; it now also shows a "Latest reply" block with a Processed/Raw toggle for
      the chat's most recent character message — Raw is the model's exact output before scene-tag
      extraction ever touches it (`combinedRaw` in `useChatSession.ts`'s `runGeneration`), Processed
      is what's actually stored/rendered. New `StoredMessage.rawText`/`swipeRawTexts` (parallel to
      `swipes`/`swipeScenes`), written alongside them at every generation completion and kept in
      sync when swiping between alternates. Deliberately narrow: only the latest reply, not every
      message in the transcript — matches this item's own "a small addition to the same panel, not
      a new one." A message from before this field existed just has no raw text; the toggle
      disables itself and says so rather than showing stale/empty data. Verified live: generated a
      fresh reply, confirmed `rawText` round-trips via a direct `/api/chats/:id/messages` fetch and
      the UI toggle switches between the two views; an older message in the same chat correctly
      showed the "generated before this toggle existed" fallback instead of a blank Raw tab.
- [x] **High-contrast theme preset**: this app already has `fontScale`, `reducedMotion`, and
      `reducedAudio` (section 6), plus full theme customization, but nothing bundled a one-click
      "high contrast" look the way AI Dungeon's accessibility settings do. Added a third entry to
      `THEME_PRESETS` in `src/lib/store/themePresets.ts` (same mechanism as Sakura/Neon Night, so
      `ThemeEditor.tsx` needed no changes to pick it up) tuned for contrast rather than mood:
      near-black-on-white / near-white-on-black text (~19:1, past WCAG's 7:1 "AAA" bar), an
      actually-visible black/white border instead of the default's subtle divider (WCAG 1.4.11
      non-text contrast), and a bright accent picked per-mode for legibility over brand consistency
      — blue on white in light mode, gold on black in dark, since one hue rarely reads well against
      both. Larger-text is still just the existing `fontScale` slider, not part of this preset.
      **Live-verified in browser**: applied from Settings → Appearance → Presets in both dark mode
      (confirmed via computed `getComputedStyle` on `:root` — `--c-bg: 0 0 0`, `--c-text: 255 255
      255`, `--c-accent: 255 210 0`, `--c-border: 255 255 255`) and light mode (toggled the
      editor's Light/Dark switch, confirmed via the persisted `rp-settings` store —
      `themeTokensLight` held the expected white/black/blue values, `colorMode` flipped to
      `"light"`), matching `themePresets.ts` exactly in both cases.
- [x] **Rewind: delete a message and everything after it, in one action** — done. New
      `rewindToMessage()` (`useChatSession.ts`): finds the target message's index in the already-
      loaded, already-ordered `messages` array and removes it plus everything after, reusing the
      existing single-message `messagesApi.remove()` primitive rather than adding a new bulk-delete
      server route — a local single-user chat's message count never justifies one. A new "Rewind to
      here" icon (`History`, lucide) sits in `MessageBubble`'s per-message hover row, next to Fork
      and Delete, behind the same `confirm()` pattern already used for chat deletion and ending a
      relationship — one shared implementation reaches both the ordinary chat view and VN mode's
      backlog drawer, since both render through the same `MessageLog`/`MessageBubble`. Verified live
      against disposable test data (a throwaway character + chat + 5 messages created directly via
      the API, matching item 78's own verification convention): rewinding from the 3rd message
      correctly left exactly the first two, confirmed via a fresh `GET`; the browser automation's
      own auto-dismissed `confirm()` was itself useful negative-case coverage — clicking without
      confirming correctly left the chat untouched. Cleaned up the test character/chat afterward.
- [ ] **Combinatorial character creation**: a lighter alternative to the two creation paths that
      already exist (`TemplateGallery`'s fixed starter cards, and `GenerateCharacterDialog`'s
      free-text-brief-to-full-card generation) — pick from small independent trait lists (an
      archetype, an occupation, a defining quirk, a relationship-to-player starter) and have the
      model assemble an opening description/personality from the combination, the same idea as AI
      Dungeon's Character Creator Scenarios. Sits between "start from a fixed template" and "type a
      paragraph and hope the brief was specific enough" — worth prototyping as a third tab
      alongside the two `CharacterEditor` "New character" entry points rather than replacing either.
- [ ] **A named progression for onboarding, not just a feature list**: AI Dungeon's own framing —
      Beginner writes a prompt, Intermediate adds Plot Essentials/Story Cards, Advanced builds a
      Scenario, Expert builds branching/Character Creator content, Developer writes scripts — is a
      genuinely useful *organizing principle* to borrow even though none of its individual rungs
      map onto this app one-to-one. Section 13's own open items (a real "Basic" mode that hides
      whole `CharacterEditor` tabs, world templates as "which mechanics apply") are already reaching
      for the same idea without naming it. Worth stating explicitly once world templates (10e) and
      the per-chat/per-world assist-toggle gating above have landed: a first chat only ever needs
      "type and talk"; the dating-sim/world-sim/instruct-template/regex-script/(eventual scripting)
      layers should read as *rungs to climb into*, not a wall of settings a new user meets on day
      one. Not a feature to build so much as a lens for sequencing section 13's remaining work.

## 16. Immersion depth: overnight expansion (2026-09-06)

A user-directed overnight pass across ten specific gaps in speech fidelity, sexual-scene
depth, slow-burn realism, gifting, steering, world liveliness, group-chat dynamics, the
VN sensory loop, and author tooling, run as three file-partitioned concurrent agents plus
a final integration pass wiring their independently-tested modules into the live prompt.

- [x] **Sexual-scene state machine** — [`src/lib/dating/intimacyScene.ts`](src/lib/dating/intimacyScene.ts):
      a real `IntimacyPhase` (`'building'|'peak'`), deliberately separate from `aftercare.ts`'s
      `Afterglow` (which judges the aftermath, not where a scene currently stands). Re-centers on
      every intimacy-catalog click — itself the consent-checkpoint for a changed trajectory, since
      every position/toy/activity already goes through the same warmth/commitment-gated catalog.
      Advances via a new conditional field on the existing `assessRelationshipMoment` judge call (no
      new AI call), and feeds phase-scaled sensory guidance plus "you are currently in X, doing Y"
      physical continuity into `styleGuidance`.
- [x] **Asymmetric pacing & lingering rebuffs** — `momentum.ts` gained `nextInitiativeBalance`/
      `asymmetricPacingNote` (same decayed-running-value shape as momentum itself), wired into
      `buildRelationshipDescription`. [`src/lib/dating/rebuff.ts`](src/lib/dating/rebuff.ts) gives a
      deflected/backfired commitment or intimacy-milestone ask a lingering, decaying "recently
      rebuffed" cue (5 char-replies), distinct from the hard `relationshipWarning` banner.
- [x] **Gifting depth** — `gifts.ts` gained a bounded recency log (`giftLog`), a repetition
      multiplier softening a same-gift streak toward hollow, a real cost when an authored dislike
      repeats, and a one-shot `giftReactionGuidance` steer. A genuinely loved gift hooks into the
      existing `ChatFact` system for later callback continuity instead of new storage.
- [x] **A deterministic hard rail + mid-scene steer** —
      [`src/lib/dating/boundaryGuard.ts`](src/lib/dating/boundaryGuard.ts): a conservative, non-AI
      lexical check of a finished reply against the character's authored `boundaries`, surfaced as
      an informational toast (never a silent auto-reroll, left unverified for tonight).
      [`src/lib/dating/steer.ts`](src/lib/dating/steer.ts) + `regenerateWithSteer`: a one-shot
      "correct the scene" regenerate, wired in the hook. **Open**: the UI trigger for it belongs in
      `ChatWindow`/`Composer` and hasn't been added yet.
- [x] **Authored state over generic romance tropes** — `authoredStatePriorityNote`
      (`mindGuidance.ts`): fires only on a real tension (a resistant mood, or the character
      deliberately holding back) and states explicitly that authored state wins over generic
      romantic instinct.
- [x] **Consequence chains & secondhand social reactions** —
      [`src/lib/world/triggers.ts`](src/lib/world/triggers.ts) gained a `trigger_fired` condition
      (same-pass and cross-turn chaining, resolved internally, no caller change needed) and a
      `social_reaction` action; [`src/lib/world/ambientEvents.ts`](src/lib/world/ambientEvents.ts)
      gained `selectSocialReaction`/`describeSocialReaction`, picking a named, already-authored
      `socialConnections` entry to have "heard about" a topic and relay it secondhand, never
      appearing in-scene themselves. Wired live in `useChatSession.ts`'s trigger-action loop.
- [x] **Per-participant relationship archetypes for group chats** —
      [`src/lib/chat/participantArchetype.ts`](src/lib/chat/participantArchetype.ts): closed a
      confirmed gap where a non-primary speaker got zero relationship-flavor guidance (silently
      borrowing the primary's romantic warmth by default). `participantRelationshipGuidance` gives
      every non-primary speaker independent footing plus an archetype-specific tone (rival /
      found-family / mentor-mentee / power-imbalanced) via `findArchetypeMatch` over authored
      `socialConnections`. Wired live in `useChatSession.ts` for every non-primary speaker.
- [x] **Ambient world-event hooks reach the live per-turn prompt, not just proactive outreach** —
      `world/ambientEvents.ts`'s `selectAmbientEvent`/`ambientEventGuidance` (holiday, weather-
      loved/hated, routine-absence, goal-on-mind, free-time-interest — all grounded in a character's
      own authored data) were built and wired into `outreach.ts` earlier the same night, but the
      per-turn channel was left as a documented integration point; now wired into
      `useChatSession.ts`'s `styleGuidance` assembly alongside `sceneNudge`, same live-event
      suppression rule.
- [x] **Voice fingerprint** — `Character.voiceFingerprint` (verbal tics, catchphrases, dialect/
      register notes, sentence rhythm), editable on the Voice tab, plus `detectVoiceFingerprint()` —
      a deterministic n-gram/heuristic pass over the card's own example dialogue, not a model call
      (mechanical properties a `split()` counts perfectly and a small model counts unreliably).
      Reaches the model with zero prompt-builder changes: folded into `buildCharacterProfileNote()`.
- [x] **VN text-vs-tag consistency check** — `sceneVision.ts`'s `detectExpressionTextMismatch()`: a
      cheap, text-only classifier (same shape as the existing `detectGreetingScene`) catches a stale
      expression tag contradicting what the text just showed and corrects the *tag* to match the
      text. Deliberately expression-only, never outfit (outfit's stickiness is a deliberate existing
      guarantee). **Open**: not yet wired into the live generation path — needs care around exactly
      where in the streaming/auto-continue flow a single classifier call belongs; left undone
      pending a closer look rather than risking a rushed edit to that path.
- [x] **"Maximum Immersion" one-click preset** —
      [`src/lib/prompt/immersionPreset.ts`](src/lib/prompt/immersionPreset.ts): applies the
      "Immersive, no meta" system prompt, the "Creative" sampler preset, slow-burn pacing, and VN
      mode in one click from `CharacterEditor`'s Advanced tab, with "Dating Sim" world template and
      per-world intimacy rating named as explicit recommendations rather than silently applied.

**Still open, not part of this pass**: the steer-control's UI trigger (function exists, no button
yet), the VN mismatch-check's live wiring, and persona-description boundary matching (the boundary
guard only reads `Character.boundaries` today).

## Suggested next steps

Done so far (see checked boxes above for detail):
1. ~~Fix the two cheap duplication bugs~~ — `RELATIONSHIP_MILESTONES`/`SCENE_FLAGS` centralized in `stage.ts`.
2. ~~Toast/error system~~ — `useToastStore.ts` + `ToastViewport.tsx`.
3. ~~Character/world pack export~~ — `src/lib/characters/pack.ts`, `.rppack.json`.
4. ~~Chat forking~~ — `Chat.parentChatId`/`forkedFromMessageId`, `POST /api/chats/:id/fork`.
5. ~~Per-character voice + a relationship-starter blurb~~ — `Character.voice`,
   `Character.relationshipStarters[]`.
6. ~~Fixed the broken local dev environment~~ — `better-sqlite3` crashed the server outright on
   this machine; swapped for Node's built-in `node:sqlite` (section 9).
7. ~~Authorable relationship thresholds + gift catalog CRUD~~ — `WorldCard.relationshipThresholds`
   and `WorldCard.gifts[]` (section 2), the harder half of item 1 above plus the gift-catalog item.
   Scene-flag authoring (custom flags beyond the fixed 4) shipped later, as item 54.
8. ~~Accessibility pass + theme/objective API gaps~~ — `aria-label`s added throughout (section 9);
   `PUT /api/themes/:id` and `DELETE /api/objectives/:id` (section 9).
9. ~~One-click full backup/restore~~ — `GET /api/backup` / `POST /api/restore`, Settings → Data
   (section 7).
10. ~~Sprite crossfade~~ — `useSpriteCrossfade` in `VNStage.tsx` (section 1). Outfit/pose layering
    remains open, and is a separate, larger effort.
11. ~~Multi-dimensional relationship stats~~ — `Chat.relationshipStats`, `computeWarmth()`, the
    6-stage `RelationshipStage` ladder, `assessRelationshipDeltas` (sections 2 and 10c). The rest
    of 10c's lifecycle work (event-sourced history, DTR ladder, breakups, endings gallery) stays
    open.
12. ~~Request timeouts~~ — `client.ts`'s `request()` and `kobold.ts`'s shared `req()` helper both
    now bound how long a hung connection can wedge a call (section 9).
13. ~~Test suite~~ — `vitest`, 50 tests across `jsonRepair`/`cardSpec`/`activation` (section 9).
    Caught and fixed a real dead-code bug in manual-mode lorebook activation along the way.
14. ~~Avatar/sprite upload validation~~ — `decodeImageDataUrl()` rejects bad mime types and
    oversized images instead of silently coercing/allowing them; wired to `toastError()` in the
    three save flows that upload images (section 9).
15. ~~Surfacing actual max-context~~ — `KoboldClient.getEffectiveMaxContext()` replaces the
    hardcoded `4096` in every judge/assist call, and is shown in `ConnectionSettings`/
    `ConnectionBadge` (section 8).
16. ~~World clock: calendar + deterministic weather/mood~~ — the first actual piece of section 10
    itself (10a), not pre-10 polish like 1-15 above. `src/lib/world/calendar.ts` (17 tests),
    `WorldCard.currentDay`/`currentPhaseIndex`, `Character.weatherPreferences`, a "World clock"
    control in `WorldsView`, and one deterministic line merged into every prompt via
    `describeWorldMoment()`. Resolves the Character-vs-Chat-vs-World anchoring question section 10's
    intro raises, for this case: the clock is world-level shared state, weather/mood are never
    stored at all (recomputed on demand). Energy/action economy and the currency ledger remain
    open — the clock only advances via a manual control for now, not real play actions.
17. ~~Relationship state reaching the model, not just unlock gates~~ — `buildRelationshipDescription()`
    (section 2), plus the two classifier calls it depends on merged into one (`assessRelationshipMoment()`),
    an `autoTrackRelationship` toggle, and milestone/unlock toasts.
18. ~~Append-only relationship history + durable facts~~ — `RelationshipEvent` and `ChatFact`
    (sections 2, 10f): a full audit trail of every stat change/flag/reason, and free-text facts the
    model is told not to re-discover, both reaching the prompt through existing machinery
    (facts via a synthetic lorebook, history via a `RelationshipPanel` log) rather than new prompt
    sections.
19. ~~World Info / lorebook depth~~ — probability, inclusion groups, regex keys, and recursive
    scanning added to `activateWorldInfo()` (section 3); sticky and cooldown followed in #94,
    leaving only `delay` short of SillyTavern's own activation engine.
20. ~~Message search and bookmarks/pinned messages~~ — `SearchPanel.tsx` (this-chat/all-chats),
    `PinnedMessagesPanel.tsx`, `StoredMessage.pinned`, and a shared scroll-to-message + highlight
    mechanism used by both (section 4).
21. ~~Chat export as a readable HTML transcript~~ — `src/lib/export/chatTranscript.ts` (section 4).
22. ~~Group chats: multiple speaking characters~~ — `Chat.participants`/`StoredMessage.speakerId`,
    a manual "reply as" picker, and the real per-turn speaker-naming bug it fixed along the way
    (section 4). Shipped as a deliberately minimal slice — see that bullet for the full list of
    what's cut (no `Scene` entity, no AI-directed turns, VN sprites stay primary-only).
23. ~~Schedules: per-character routine + presence status~~ — `Character.schedule`,
    `getCurrentActivity()`/`describePresence()`, a presence badge in both the chat header and the
    chat list (section 10f) — the explicit prerequisite for proactive outreach (phase 2 of section
    10's own suggested order) taken as its own deterministic first slice, the same way the world
    clock was taken as section 10a's first slice earlier.
24. ~~Custom expressions + a fixed click bug~~ — user-reported: no way to add an expression beyond
    the built-in 16, and separately, clicking an expression's box didn't open the file picker at
    all (a stale implicit `<label>`/multi-input association bug). Both fixed (section 3).
25. ~~Broadened default expressions with love/arousal range~~ — user-requested: flirty, smitten,
    yearning, sultry, aroused (section 1).
26. ~~Two more theme presets, Sakura and Neon Night~~ — the roadmap's own next `[ ]` item in section
    5 once the curated "next steps" list above ran out of anything unblocked to work on.
27. ~~Manga/anime font pairing for character name-plates~~ — self-hosted Zen Maru Gothic,
    deliberately scoped to name-plates only, not editor/settings chrome (section 5).
28. ~~Save-safe end-of-date scoring~~ — 10b's first slice: `DateEventCard.startedAt` marks a live
    date, per-turn scoring is suppressed while one's active, and `endDateEvent()`/`assessDateOutcome()`
    run a single whole-transcript judge pass when it ends (section 10b). Also fixed a genuine latent
    bug surfaced while verifying it live: clearing `Chat.activeEvent` via the generic PUT-merge API
    silently did nothing, because `JSON.stringify` drops `undefined`-valued object keys before the
    request body is even sent — switched both clearing call sites to send `null` instead.
29. ~~Difficulty setting~~ — a global Gentle/Normal/Harsh scale (`relationshipDifficulty` in
    `useSettingsStore`) applied as a single delta multiplier at the one choke point both the
    per-turn and end-of-date scoring paths already share, so it can never touch a judge prompt or
    a character's own generation (section 10b).
30. ~~`*action text*`/"quoted dialogue" emphasis~~ — `splitMessageSegments()`/`renderMessageText()`
    (section 5), feeding CSS (`.prose-rp em`/`.rp-quote`) that had existed unused since before this
    file did. Caught two real `*/`-inside-a-comment bugs along the way (section 5's own writeup has
    the detail).
31. ~~Portrait grid hover glow~~ — a shared `.portrait-frame` class for `CharacterList`/`WorldsView`
    (section 5): an accent glow ring plus a contained gentle zoom on hover, respecting both the
    app's and the OS's reduced-motion settings.
32. ~~Milestones: banner + keepsake memory~~ — crossing into a higher warmth band now records a
    `ChatFact` alongside the existing toast (section 10c); `crossedMilestone()` extracted to
    `stage.ts` with its own unit tests. The next-morning-text and social-circle-ripple parts of
    this item stay open, blocked on machinery (proactive outreach, group/social features) that
    doesn't exist yet.
33. ~~Energy/action economy core + a first Economy earning hook~~ — 10a's last two open items,
    both taken as deliberately narrower first slices: `getMaxEnergyForDay`/`getEnergyRemaining`/
    `spendEnergy` in `calendar.ts` (10 new tests) give the day a real, derived action pool that
    starting a date now spends and can run out of ("Sleep" — an automatic roll to next morning);
    a date's outcome now earns coins scaled to how it went, rather than the flat/handed-out coin
    flows that existed before. Hangouts, work shifts, "Together," minigames, the AI-narrated
    day-recap, and a shared per-world wallet all stay open — each needs machinery (10b/10d, or an
    NPC-simulation groundwork from section 12) this slice deliberately didn't build.
34. ~~Endings gallery~~ — `GalleryEntry.isEnding` unlocks deterministically at the `sweethearts`
    stage via a new `unlockedEndingIds()` (10c), bypassing the AI CG-matching pass entirely and
    reusing the existing gallery-unlock set for "once per relationship." Scoped to today's actual
    top stage rather than the DTR-ladder tiers ("living together") the original wording named,
    since that ladder doesn't exist yet.
35. ~~Authored reactions~~ — `Character.giftLikes`/`giftDislikes`/`loveLanguage` (10d) feed the
    model directly, alongside (not replacing) the numeric `giftPreferences` score that still drives
    the mechanical affection delta — folded into the same always-on relationship-description
    prompt line, so no new "a gift was just given" detection was needed.
36. ~~Define-the-Relationship ladder~~ — `Chat.commitmentStatus` (10c), a track separate from the
    warmth-derived stage; warmth only gates *asking*, `assessCommitmentAsk()` judges accept/
    deflect/backfire from the actual scene rather than a coin flip or a hardcoded timing rule.
37. ~~Breakups & reconciliation~~ — closes out 10c. A committed relationship under real strain
    raises a warning and, unresolved, actually breaks with a one-time stat scar
    (`evaluateRelationshipRisk`/`applyBreakupScar` in `stage.ts`); reconciliation needed no new
    mechanics at all since the existing DTR "ask" flow already handles winning someone back.
38. ~~Bag/inventory view + Item catalog beyond gifts~~ — closes out 10d. A new `BagPanel` gives
    gifts a manual "give this now" path that didn't exist before (only AI-suggested choices could
    give one); `WorldCard.items[]` is a separate per-world catalog with an authored, deterministic
    effect (relationship nudge, scene flag, or coins), used from the same Bag with no judge call.
39. ~~Bulk sprite upload by filename~~ — user-requested: a character's expression art is often
    already named after the expression (`laughing.png`), so a new multi-file picker in
    `CharacterEditor` matches filenames to expression ids in one pass instead of one upload per
    slot. Surfaced and fixed a real pre-existing bug: many sprites in one save could exceed
    Express's 25MB body limit — raised to 150MB.
40. ~~Fixed: VN sprite silently cropped on a wide-but-short window~~ — user-reported, reproduced
    directly. A classic flexbox bug (a flex child's `min-height: auto` default refusing to shrink
    below the sprite's natural size, silently clipped by the stage's own `overflow-hidden`) —
    fixed with `min-h-0` on the sprite's container, the standard fix for this bug class.
41. ~~Fixed: `GET /api/personas/:id` route entirely missing~~ — found live, during a full Sumire
    playthrough QA pass. Characters/chats/worlds all had a get-by-id route; personas never did, so
    `personasApi.get(chat.personaId)` 404'd on every chat this app has ever had, and the persona
    query in `useChatSession` always silently resolved to `undefined` — invisible until now only
    because every persona created this session happened to be named "You" (the same as the
    fallback string), making broken and working output indistinguishable. Added the route;
    verified via direct fetch and the Prompt Inspector showing the real persona description
    reaching the model.
42. ~~Fixed: a failed generation permanently corrupted chat history with fake dialogue~~ — found
    live right after a real koboldcpp disconnect/reconnect. The old catch-block wrote the literal
    string "⚠ Generation failed..." into the message's real `text`, which would (a) get fed to the
    model in every future prompt as something the character genuinely said, and (b) make
    `canContinue` true, so the Composer misleadingly offered "Continue" on a message with no real
    reply. Added `StoredMessage.failed`, keeping `text: ''` on failure with the UI
    (`MessageBubble`, `VNStage`) rendering the failure state itself, driven by the flag. Confirmed
    `regenerate()` was already unaffected since it never trusts a message's own current text.
43. ~~Fixed: an unterminated scene tag leaked into the character's saved dialogue~~ — found live.
    `extractSceneTag` only stripped `<<scene:...>>` when the model closed it with `>>`; a
    generation cut off mid-tag (hitting max tokens, or the model just never closing it) left the
    raw fragment (e.g. `<<scene:expression=embarrassed,background=library`) permanently baked into
    the character's stored `text` — visibly broken immersion, and it would keep reappearing in
    every future prompt as something the character actually said. `stripSceneTagForDisplay`
    already existed for hiding an in-progress tag during streaming and turned out to handle an
    unterminated *completed* tag just as well (it only checks that the trailing `<` begins a
    prefix of `<<scene:`, regardless of length) — reused it as `extractSceneTag`'s fallback instead
    of writing a second stripping routine.
44. ~~Fixed: the relationship-flag classifier had no definition for its own flags~~ — found live:
    `first_date` fired after a first-ever, chance library conversation with a small gift, which no
    reasonable player would call a date. `assessRelationshipMoment`/`assessDateOutcome` handed the
    model bare flag names (`first_date, confession, jealousy, promise`) with zero guidance on what
    each one actually requires, so a borderline call was left entirely to the loaded model's own
    (in this case, generous) judgment. Added a `FLAG_GLOSSARY` one-liner per flag, mirroring the
    existing `DIMENSION_GLOSSARY` pattern, so the bar is explicit instead of implied by the name —
    same fix shape as the dimension glossary that already existed for exactly this reason.
45. ~~Chat/VN UI polish pass~~ — user-reported: the chat and VN interface felt cramped ("things
    didn't really fit at all") and had an "ASCII feeling" from hand-typed glyph icons (`♡ ♥ → [i]
    ★ 🔎 🎒 ↓ ⟲ ⑂ ‹ › » @`) of inconsistent size and weight. Added `lucide-react` and replaced
    every such glyph across the chat/VN surface (header toolbar, VNStage controls, MessageBubble
    meta row, Composer, ChoiceList, toasts, the nav sidebar) with a new shared `IconButton`
    component for consistent sizing/hit-targets. Fixed the actual cramping, not just the icons:
    `ChoiceList` was three stacked full-width buttons, now wrapped pill chips; `VNStage`'s dialogue
    box grew unbounded with reply length, squeezing the sprite area to nothing on a long
    generation — now capped at `24-30vh` with internal scroll, and the sprite container has a
    `190px` floor instead of `min-h-0`'s unbounded shrink. The chats list (`ChatsPanel`) can now
    collapse to an avatar rail, matching the nav sidebar's existing collapse — a new persisted
    `chatsPanelCollapsed` setting, mirroring `sidebarExpanded`.
46. ~~VN mode: real immersion, not a chat log with art~~ — user-reported follow-up: VN mode still
    read as "a chat widget with a picture," not a visual novel — a separate white header above and
    a separate white composer below (bond/warmth literally shown twice: once in that header, once
    in VNStage's own badge), plus bad spacing on the choice chips. Folded the header entirely away
    in VN mode (`ChatWindow` renders no `<header>` when `visualNovelMode` is on) and moved its
    toolbar/persona/fork-link into `VNStage` itself via new slot props, so the bond meter now
    renders exactly once. `Composer` and `ChoiceList` both gained a `variant="vn"` that strips
    their own surface/border so they sit bare inside VNStage's own panel — which is now docked
    flush to the screen's bottom edge (no floating card with margins) and holds dialogue, choices,
    and the composer as one continuous panel with hairline dividers, the way a real VN's ADV
    textbox works, instead of three stacked app-chrome widgets. Added a proper nameplate tab
    (overlapping the panel's top edge, solid accent fill) in place of a plain inline name, replaced
    the choice chips' nested text-pill kind tag with a small icon (reads faster, one surface
    instead of a pill-in-a-pill), added a cinematic vignette and dialogue text-shadow, and merged
    the persona/bond/event badges into one HUD card with internal dividers instead of three
    separate floating chiclets. `IconButton` gained a `tone: 'glass'` variant so the same toolbar
    array renders correctly whether it's sitting on the app's own chrome or floating over scene art.
47. ~~Design-system pass: shared Modal/Section, no more hardcoded spacing per file~~ — user-reported:
    Settings and the chat modals still had an "AI-generated" feel, and paddings/margins were
    hardcoded ad hoc rather than standardized. Every one of the ~10 chat panels
    (Relationship/Objective/Event/Bag/Search/Pinned/PromptInspector/NewChat) hand-rolled its own
    near-identical `fixed inset-0 … bg-black/40` backdrop and header-with-Close row, with small
    unintentional drift between them (`mb-3` vs `mb-4`, 80/85/88vh height caps, `p-6` vs `p-4` inner
    cards). Replaced all of them with one shared `Modal` component (`src/components/ui/Modal.tsx`)
    and a `Section` component for the repeated "heading + description + padded card" block, used in
    both Settings (all 5 tabs, previously three different `max-w`/`space-y` combinations across
    tabs — now one `SettingsPage` wrapper) and inside `RelationshipPanel`'s own sub-sections.
    Added real `success`/`warning` theme tokens (Connection status was hardcoding raw
    `bg-green-500`/`bg-yellow-500`, invisible to the theme system entirely) — which surfaced a real
    bug: zustand's `persist` does a shallow merge, so a token object already in a returning user's
    localStorage fully replaced the default object instead of layering over it, permanently hiding
    any newly-added token behind `undefined`/black. Added an explicit deep-merge for
    `themeTokensLight`/`themeTokensDark`/`sampler` so a future new token or sampler param
    backfills correctly for existing users instead of silently breaking. Also enabled Inter's
    tabular-figure/slashed-zero OpenType features globally, so a changing number (warmth %, token
    counts, coin totals) never jitters in width as its digits change.
48. ~~A second accent for relationship data, separate from the UI's own~~ — user asked for a design
    pass informed by a handful of reference style guides (Linear, Index, Ciridae, Henry, Analogue).
    None of the five are app-shaped references (all five are dark cinematic marketing sites), so
    rather than importing their literal palette/type choices wholesale, pulled out the one
    principle that actually fit: the accent color was doing two unrelated jobs at once — "this is
    clickable" (buttons, active nav, toggles) and "this is how close you are with them" (the bond
    meter, relationship stats). Added a dedicated `romance`/`romance-text` token pair (a warm
    rose, distinct in hue from accent/danger/success/warning) and moved every relationship-*data*
    display onto it — the bond meter (header bar, VNStage badge, RelationshipPanel), the six
    positive relationship stat bars, active scene flags, the VN nameplate tag, and Gallery's
    "Endings" section — while every *interactive* control (buttons, the difficulty/mode pickers,
    toolbar icons) stays on the plain accent. Tension deliberately stays neutral gray rather than
    romance-tinted, since (per its own glossary entry) more tension isn't automatically "progress"
    the way the other six dimensions are. Also enabled Inter's tabular-figure/slashed-zero OpenType
    features globally (see #47) while auditing this.
    Along the way, found the `success`/`warning` tokens added in #47 had silently never actually
    worked as Tailwind utility classes (`bg-success`, `bg-warning`) since the moment they were
    added — only their raw color *values* had been verified (via the theme editor's native color
    picker, which doesn't need Tailwind at all), never an actual `bg-success`/`text-warning`
    element on screen. Root cause: Tailwind's JIT context inside the long-running dev server
    process hadn't picked up the new `tailwind.config.ts` color keys, even though Vite correctly
    detected the config change and forced a page reload — only a full dev-server restart
    regenerated the CSS. Worth remembering: a plain page reload after touching
    `tailwind.config.ts`'s color keys isn't sufficient confirmation that a new color actually
    works — check the *computed style* of a real element using the new class, not just the token's
    raw value.
49. ~~Bundled starter content: one world, one character, one World Info book~~ — the 12 scene
    backgrounds the user supplied (`scenes/` at the repo root) are now committed at
    `seed/backgrounds/` (renamed to match the background ids) and used to seed a bundled world,
    "Sakura Hill University" — all 12 backgrounds, a themed gift/item catalog (showcasing all
    three `ItemEffect` kinds), a few affection-gated background unlocks, and its own embedded
    lorebook. Sumire (edited into a university student for this) ships as its resident character,
    with scenario/first message/3 alternate greetings/example dialogue/gift preferences/3
    relationship starters/weather preferences/an 8-entry schedule/a 4-entry `character_book` — every
    field the user asked for. A separate standalone World Info book, "Sakura Hill — Campus Life,"
    demonstrates the mechanics a character's own lore can't show off in isolation: an always-on
    entry, a plain keyword entry, a selective (primary AND secondary key) entry, a mutually-
    exclusive `group` pair, an `after_char` position entry, and a `probability` roll.
    New `server/seedContent.ts` (the actual typed data, checked against the real `Character`/
    `WorldCard`/`WorldInfoBook` interfaces — not a JSON blob that can silently drift) and
    `server/seed.ts` (the idempotent runner — checks for the seed world's own fixed id before doing
    anything, so it only ever applies once per install and never fights a user who deletes it). No
    art bundled for Sumire — the user's own uploaded sprites are private data in the gitignored
    `data/` directory, not something to redistribute; she falls back to initials like any other
    character without a portrait, same as the pre-existing behavior for characters with no
    avatarDataUrl. Confirmed `data/` was already fully gitignored (chat logs, personas, every
    avatar/sprite file) — the only things this added to git are `server/seed*.ts` and the ~35MB of
    committed background art, exactly what "comes with the webui" requires and nothing a user's
    own chat history would ever end up in.
    Along the way: `tsconfig.server.json` had no `@/*` path alias (server code had simply never
    imported anything from `src/` before), needed for `seedContent.ts` to type-check its data
    against the real card/world interfaces; adding it surfaced a real, pre-existing type looseness
    in `ttsProviders.ts` (`listKoboldSpeakers` trusted an untyped fetch response) that only failed
    under Node's `fetch` types, not DOM's — fixed properly rather than special-cased around.
    Verified live end-to-end: both Sumires coexist without id collision, every one of Sumire's new
    fields renders correctly in `CharacterEditor` (gift scores pulled from the *world's* catalog
    correctly, given she's world-bound), the world's 12 backgrounds all resolve and render as real
    images, and the World Info book's entry count matches.
50. ~~Ambient falling sakura petals behind VNStage~~ — an explicitly open, unblocked item from
    section 5 ("subtle ambient particle/gradient effects... optional falling sakura petals layer"),
    picked up as part of the same "keep improving the design" pass. Seven petals (fixed positions/
    timings, not `Math.random()` — stable across re-renders, no mid-fall jump when an unrelated
    state update repaints VNStage), each a small inline-SVG four-lobe petal shape tinted with the
    new `romance` token from #48 rather than a generic pink, so the ambient effect and the bond
    meter read as the same design language. Only mounts for backgrounds where falling petals
    actually make sense (`park`/`forest`/`rooftop`/`city-street`/`beach`) — never indoors. Respects
    the app's own `reducedMotion` setting (checked in `VNStage` before ever mounting the layer) and
    the OS-level `prefers-reduced-motion` media query as a second, independent guard (same
    convention as `.cursor-blink`/`.vn-sprite-bob`). Verified live: 7 running animations confirmed
    via computed style on an outdoor background, 0 petals confirmed on an indoor one.
51. ~~Bug-hunt pass: database, character, world, and lorebook systems~~ — user asked to keep
    polishing these four areas and fixing bugs rather than pick up a new roadmap item, so this
    batch went looking rather than waiting for another live playthrough to surface something. Four
    parallel audits found and this pass fixed: the `undefined`-drops-from-`JSON.stringify` bug
    (previously fixed once for `Chat.activeEvent`, item 28) recurring across eight `CharacterEditor`
    fields, so clearing a character's world binding/voice/love-language/schedule/etc. silently
    no-op'd; the same fields missing from `.rppack.json` export/import; the World editor's general
    "Save changes" silently reverting the live world clock to a stale mount-time snapshot; two
    dangling-reference bugs (deleting a persona or a forked-from chat left other records pointing
    at a dead id); a non-atomic `/api/restore` that could leave the DB in a mixed old/new state on
    a partial failure; an orphaned-avatar-file disk leak on format-changing re-uploads; lorebook
    import silently dropping `probability`/`group`; regex lorebook keys ignoring `case_sensitive`;
    a lorebook's `scan_depth` being completely ignored; a fractional item-effect amount silently
    replaced with `1` instead of rounded; plus two minor polish items (a double-click guard, an
    aria-label). See section 9's own writeup for the full per-bug detail and how each was verified
    live against the running dev server. Section 9 for section-level context on the code paths.
52. ~~Lorebook editor: UI for `selective`/`secondary_keys`, `case_sensitive`, `insertion_order`,
    and `position`~~ — a direct follow-on from item 51's audit: `activateWorldInfo` already fully
    supported all five (and import already preserved them), but a creator writing an entry from
    scratch in-app had no way to set any of them — only imported cards could ever use half of the
    activation engine's own feature surface. Added to `LorebookEditor.tsx`: "Order"
    (`insertion_order`) and "Position" (before/after the character) now show for every entry;
    "Case sensitive" and "Also require a secondary key" (with a secondary-keys field when toggled
    on) show for keyword-mode entries specifically, since case sensitivity and AND-logic secondary
    matching are meaningless for always/manual entries. Verified live against the seeded "Sakura
    Hill — Campus Life" book, which was built specifically to demonstrate these: confirmed its
    existing selective (café/coffee/cafe + exam/exams/finals secondary keys) and `after_char`
    entries render with the right toggle/field state on load, then round-tripped a real edit
    (toggled Case sensitive on the "library" entry, confirmed via a fresh server refetch, reverted).
53. ~~10e: authoring depth — life-context fields~~ — user picked this explicitly (offered a choice
    between this, proactive-outreach design work, and multi-character relationship tracking) as
    the next roadmap item after 51/52's bug-hunt closed out. Eight new `Character` fields
    (likes/goals/boundaries, social connections, occupation/workplace, home/frequented locations,
    a date-mode opt-out flag), three new `CharacterEditor` sections, and — the part that makes
    this more than inert data entry — a new `characterProfile` prompt block so the authored life
    details actually reach the model, plus real mechanical enforcement of the one content flag
    (hides the date-event button entirely, not just cosmetically). See section 9's changelog for
    the full writeup. Deliberately left the other three 10e bullets untouched: "guaranteed
    expression coverage" is entangled with 10b's live-date mode, which doesn't exist yet;
    "AI-assisted authoring" and "world templates" are separate, sizable pieces of their own.
54. ~~Scene-flag authoring — custom flags beyond the fixed 4~~ — user asked to pick up "the
    easiest first" between this and lorebook sticky/cooldown, both flagged by the roadmap as
    deliberately-narrow still-open follow-ups; sizing both first (rather than guessing) surfaced a
    real risk in sticky/cooldown — no stable per-entry key exists across this app's lorebook
    sources, and a group chat's array ordering isn't even stable turn to turn — that made scene
    flags the clearly smaller, lower-risk pick, additive on top of the existing 4 the same way
    custom expressions (item 24) were additive on top of the default 16. See section 9's changelog
    for the full writeup.
55. ~~Author's Note~~ — the first item off the new section 14 (competitive parity), picked as the
    smallest steering lever with the biggest payoff for a user arriving from SillyTavern.
    `Chat.authorNote` + `AuthorNotePanel` + a `builder.ts` injection pass supporting three
    positions (`before_char` / `after_char` / `at_depth` with a depth slider). Fully verifiable
    with KoboldCpp off — the Prompt Inspector shows it landing in the assembled prompt. See
    section 14's checked item for the full writeup; `everyNTurns` and per-character/world default
    notes deliberately deferred.
56. ~~Global-lorebook binding UI~~ — second item off section 14, and a half-built feature finished
    rather than a new one: `WorldInfoBook.boundChatIds` was honored but had no UI, so every
    standalone book was silently active everywhere. Added `boundCharacterIds`/`boundWorldIds`, a
    `src/lib/worldinfo/scope.ts` decision function (7 tests), a `BookScopePicker`, and scope
    summaries in the book list. See section 14's checked sub-item for detail.
57. ~~Authoring-UI rebuild — Worlds, World Info, Characters, Personas~~ — user asked for these to
    feel "clean, polished, less AI-slop." The common problems: a flat wall of ~13 identical
    `<details>` cards per editor, three different ways to style a number input, hand-typed `✕`/`+`
    glyphs (the same "ASCII feeling" #45 fixed in chat), weak `text-sm` view headers, a
    non-sticky save row lost at the bottom of a 1200px form. Built shared primitives —
    `EditorShell` (fixed header with a back button + eyebrow/title, an optional tab strip, a
    sticky save/delete footer), `NumberField`/`SelectField` (matching `TextField`), `Chip` (the
    toggle-pill pattern), `ListEditor` (the "list of removable cards + Add button" repeated for
    gallery/starters/social/schedule/gifts/items/flags), `FileButton` — then rebuilt all four
    views on them. `CharacterEditor`: 7 tabs (Identity / Life & background / Visual novel / Dating
    sim / World sim / Voice / Advanced) instead of one endless scroll. `WorldEditor`: 5 tabs
    (Overview / Lore / Scenes / Dating sim / Clock). `LorebookEditor`: each entry's power-user
    knobs (order, position, chance, group, case-sensitivity, secondary keys) collapse behind a
    per-entry "Options" disclosure. List views got `font-display` headers and dashed-card empty
    states with a primary action. Every save path preserved exactly — verified live end-to-end
    that a full Sumire save still round-trips schedule/gift-preferences/starters/weather/lorebook
    with nothing dropped. 174 tests green, typecheck + build clean. Partly closes section 13's
    "actionable empty states" and "inline help on dense screens" (see those items for what's left).
58. ~~On-disk persistence audit + WAL checkpoint on shutdown~~ — user asked to confirm data is
    "saved on the computer, not browser cache." Confirmed: every entity (characters, chats,
    messages, worlds, lorebooks, personas, objectives, relationship events, facts, saved
    themes/presets) lives in `data/rp.db` (SQLite/WAL); images in `data/avatars/<kind>/<id>/…`;
    `data/` is gitignored; `useApiQuery` uses zero browser storage; the only `localStorage` key
    (`rp-settings`) holds per-device UI preference only (server URL, active ids, theme colours,
    layout toggles, sampler defaults, voice config). Added a `checkpointDb()` (`PRAGMA
    wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) run on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` in `server/index.ts` so a clean Ctrl+C
    folds the write-ahead log back into `rp.db` — WAL writes were always durable, this just spares
    anyone who copies `rp.db` without its `-wal` sidecar. Documented the full layout in the README.
59. ~~Regex / find-and-replace scripts~~ — third item off section 14. `Settings.regexScripts` +
    `RegexScriptsSection` + a pure `applyRegexScripts` (12 tests) wired into `renderMessageText`
    (display: chat / VN / transcript export) and `builder.ts`'s `renderTurn` (prompt: history
    turns, visible in the Prompt Inspector). Stored messages untouched, so a rule is reversible by
    disabling it. See section 14's checked item for detail. Verified live with a `WIDGET → gizmo`
    rule showing in both the rendered message and the assembled prompt.
60. ~~Per-turn assist "thinking" indicator~~ — the (b) slice of section 9's assist-orchestration
    item. Post-reply assist calls now run through a `runAssist` tracker in `useChatSession`,
    surfaced as a thin pulsing strip above the composer (`AssistActivityBar`, chat + VN) so a
    relationship delta or choice card that lands a few seconds late reads as expected work. Calls
    reordered player-facing-first; the four Settings toggle descriptions rewritten to be honest
    about the per-reply model-call cost. The (a) merge and (c) one-switch "minimal assists"
    profile stay open — (c) is blocked on world templates (10e).
61. ~~Read CCv3 character cards~~ — fourth item off section 14. `extractCardAssets` (`cardSpec.ts`,
    10 tests) reads a `chara_card_v3` `data.assets` array — `icon` → portrait, `emotion` →
    expression sprites (with ~30 name aliases; unknowns become custom expressions). Wired through
    `importCharacterFile` → `CharacterEditor.applyImport`. `ccdefault:`/`embeded://`/`http:` URIs
    skipped; `background`/`user_icon` ignored (no home on a character import). Verified live with a
    hand-built V3 JSON. `.charx` zip reading and V3 export stay open.
62. ~~First-run Welcome screen~~ — section 13's headline item. A `WelcomeView` takes over the chat
    tab on an install with no chats (`ChatSurface` in `App.tsx`): a connection card that
    background-probes the common KoboldCpp ports and offers one-click switching + an inline URL
    field, and a "Chat with Sumire" card that opens `NewChatDialog` pre-selected. Also closes
    section 13's "actionable empty states" (the zero-chats case was its last unfinished slice).
    Verified live end-to-end. Multi-screen stepper + forced persona step deliberately skipped.
63. ~~Persona nudge~~ — section 13. `NewChatDialog`, when no personas exist, offers inline
    "Your name" / "a line about you" fields and mints a reusable persona from them on start,
    instead of silently sending the model a hardcoded "You". Once a persona exists, the normal
    dropdown returns. ~40 lines, one file.
64. ~~Instruct-template manager~~ — the first item off the "still unblocked" list below, parts (a)
    and (b) of section 14's prompt/context-template-manager bullet: duplicate + edit + save a
    custom instruct template, and a per-character override. See that section's checked item for
    the full writeup; (c) — section order/enable flags as data — stays open.
65. ~~World templates~~ — pulled forward out of section 10e per this file's own note that it's the
    structural fix for "which toggles do I want." A creation-time picker (Freeform RP / Visual
    Novel / Dating Sim / Slice of Life) that narrows which `WorldEditor` tabs show up, editable
    after the fact via a Chip picker. See section 10e's checked item for the full writeup,
    including what's honestly still open (it doesn't yet gate the global assist-toggle settings).
66. ~~UI SFX + `reducedAudio` setting~~ — the last item off that same list. A synthesized (not
    shipped-as-files) message-send blip and a milestone/unlock reward chime, muted by a new
    `reducedAudio` setting next to `reducedMotion`. See section 6's checked item for the full
    writeup.
67. ~~Auto-continue truncated replies~~ — user-reported live, once koboldcpp was actually running
    for a real testing pass: replies sometimes ended mid-sentence. `runGeneration` now detects a
    reply that used its full `max_length` budget and automatically extends it (up to 2 extra
    rounds) the same way the existing manual "Continue" button already does. See section 8's
    checked item for the full writeup, including how it was stress-tested.
68. ~~Writing-style steering~~ — user-requested: no em dashes, less "AI slop" phrasing generally.
    A global `styleGuidance` note plus a dedicated `avoidEmDashes` toggle, injected right before
    generation for reliability, backed by an auto-managed regex rule as a deterministic safety net
    for the em-dash case specifically. See section 8's checked item for the full writeup.
69. ~~Background art not showing~~ — user-reported live: VN mode showed only a placeholder
    gradient behind an otherwise fully-sprited character. Root cause wasn't missing art at all —
    it was a character with no world bound, so there was nowhere to source background images from
    regardless of the model's own scene tags. Fixed by binding the affected character to the
    existing seeded world, whose background set already covered every default location. Confirmed
    live: the same scene now renders real background art matching the tagged location. See section
    13's "VN mode reads as broken before art exists" item for the general gap this is one instance
    of, which stays open.
70. ~~Gate relationship-tracking/choice-suggestion assists per-chat~~ — the real remaining half of
    world templates (#65), picked specifically because it needed koboldcpp actually running to
    verify correctly. `Chat.assistOverrides`, seeded from the bound world's template at chat
    creation, editable after via two new selects in `RelationshipPanel.tsx`. See section 10e's
    world-templates item for the full writeup. `visualNovelMode` per-chat/per-world gating stayed
    open at the time — a bigger, rendering-level change, not a natural extension of this pass — and
    shipped later, in #76.
71. ~~Mobile/responsive layout, first slice~~ — the item flagged as "the single biggest limiter on
    who can use the app at all," picked next since it didn't need koboldcpp specifically. Bottom
    nav below `md`, the chat list and chat window each full-width and toggled instead of
    permanently side by side, a back button in both chat header styles. Two real off-screen
    overflow bugs (VN toolbar pill, ordinary header toolbar) and one real dead-end (unreachable
    Settings tabs) found by measuring actual element geometry live rather than trusting a
    screenshot, all fixed. See section 14's checked item for the full writeup, including what a
    full mobile pass still needs beyond this first slice.
72. ~~10f's runtime-state-snapshot + context-budget-tiers groundwork, the koboldcpp-independent
    slice~~ — asked for explicitly: "finish section 10," specifically the parts that don't need
    koboldcpp turned on. Checked what's genuinely blocked (10b's live date mode and 10e's
    AI-assisted authoring are meaningless without a model to actually generate with; 10f's
    proactive outreach needs a design decision, not more coding time, before any code) versus
    what's pure deterministic prompt-assembly work, verifiable via the Prompt Inspector and unit
    tests alone. Found and fixed a real, previously-uncapped-forever gap: chat facts (memories)
    had no token budget at all, unlike every other lorebook, so a long enough chat's memory would
    grow without bound; now capped and recency-prioritized (`buildFactsLorebook`,
    `src/lib/worldinfo/facts.ts`). Found the identical shape of bug in authored `likes`/`goals`/
    `frequentedLocations`/`socialConnections` (`buildCharacterProfileNote`,
    `src/lib/characters/profile.ts`) and capped those too — deliberately leaving `boundaries`
    uncapped, since silently dropping a stated hard limit for space is a safety risk, not a
    token-budget nicety. See section 10f's two checked-partial items for the full writeup,
    including what's honestly still open (a true single-block consolidation, and the harder
    cross-cutting budget-tier unification) and why neither was attempted blind.

73. ~~High-contrast theme preset~~ — asked "anything else we can build, other than 10" with
    koboldcpp off; picked as one of three quick, purely-deterministic UI items alongside the
    command palette and (next) the director/debug view. Section 15's open accessibility item.
    Third `THEME_PRESETS` entry (section 14) tuned for WCAG contrast rather than mood. See section
    15's checked item for the full writeup and live-verification notes.
74. ~~Command palette / global search (Ctrl/Cmd-K)~~ — second of that same three-item batch, and
    section 13's headline discoverability gap: the nav is an icon-only rail by default, so finding
    a section (let alone a specific character/chat/world) was a hover-hunt. One input, four
    entity types, deep-links straight into the character/world editor or the right chat. Live
    verification surfaced and fixed a real keyboard-nav desync bug — the row shown as "active" and
    the row `Enter` actually activated could be two different items whenever both chat and
    character results were present. See section 13's checked item for the full writeup.

75. ~~Director/debug view~~ — third and last of that three-item batch, and section 12's headline
    item pulled forward as a quick, purely-deterministic power-user tool. Live-verified directly
    against the real in-progress Sumire save rather than a throwaway fixture — every mutating
    control was snapshotted first and reverted after, confirmed identical field-by-field. See
    section 12's checked item for the full writeup, including the one scope cut (no "set weather"
    control, since weather is a deterministic function of day, never stored, so there was nothing
    to set).

76. ~~`visualNovelMode` per-chat/per-world gating~~ — asked again to "work through all section 10
    parts that can be done with koboldcpp turned off." Re-surveyed every remaining unchecked
    section 10 item against that filter: 10b's live date mode, intent chips, live feedback, and
    real stakes all need either a live model to verify or a design call this file already flags as
    the user's to make; 10e's AI-assisted authoring needs a live model outright; 10f's proactive
    outreach is explicitly blocked on an open design question, not on koboldcpp being on or off, so
    picking it up without that answer would mean guessing at the one thing the roadmap itself says
    only the user can decide. The one item that was genuinely just deterministic, unfinished code —
    world templates' own "still open" gap, `visualNovelMode` gating — is closed out here. See
    section 10e's world templates entry for the full writeup.

77. ~~Instruct-template manager part (c): prompt-section enable flags~~ — asked to "continue
    working through the roadmap." Re-audited mobile/responsive at 375px across Characters, Worlds,
    World Info, Gallery, Personas, and every Settings tab first (the roadmap's own top pick) —
    found no new bugs; the shared `EditorShell` (Characters/Worlds/Personas) and the already-fixed
    tab-strip pattern hold up as-is. The VN toolbar now needs scrolling to reach its 12th icon
    (added since the last pass), confirmed genuinely reachable, not a regression — the roadmap's
    own "scrolls instead of picks" tradeoff, not a new bug. With mobile clean, moved to the next
    concretely-scoped item: closes out section 14's "Prompt/context template manager" in full. See
    that item's part (c) for the full writeup.

78. ~~Chat management basics: rename, duplicate, quick-new, and delete~~ — asked to "work on
    section 14." Picked this over the section's other open items since it's concretely scoped and
    fully deterministic — no live model needed to build or verify, unlike the Generation HUD
    (needs real streaming to show tokens/sec), and unlike World Info depth's sticky/cooldown gap
    or the trigger/event system, both of which have real, stated prerequisites (a stable
    cross-source lorebook key; a joint design pass with section 12's plugin hooks) rather than
    just being unbuilt. Also found, in passing, that chat deletion had a working server route with
    no UI anywhere to reach it — added alongside the three items the bullet actually named. See
    that item for the full writeup.

79. ~~Slow-burn pacing~~ — user asked, while doing a full live Sumire playthrough specifically to
    check this: make sure the roleplay isn't too fast-paced and the character isn't too willing.
    Reproduced live before fixing anything: on a fresh "Near Strangers" chat, an unprompted "Can I
    kiss you?" got a token "you can't just demand that" immediately followed by "Fine... then stop
    talking and do it already" in the *same* reply — the relationship-difficulty slider (section 2)
    only scales numeric deltas and says so in its own copy ("never what a character says or how a
    scene plays out"); nothing in the prompt actually asked the model to hold a line on scene
    content itself. Added `slowBurnPacing` (Settings → Generation → Relationship tracking, on by
    default) alongside `avoidEmDashes`/`styleGuidance` in the same "right before generation"
    steering slot: an instruction that intimacy is earned gradually and a character should react in
    character — hesitation, deflection, or an outright no — rather than caving just to be agreeable.
    Verified live: regenerated the exact same "Can I kiss you?" turn with the setting on and got a
    flat, in-character refusal instead (kept studying, wouldn't be moved), with bond/warmth
    correctly unaffected by the request either way. Deliberately a global toggle, not per-character —
    Sumire's own card already asks for "warms up slowly," but the gap this closes is the model not
    holding that line under a direct, escalating request, which isn't specific to one character card.
80. ~~AI character generation, verified~~ — same live pass: confirmed `GenerateCharacterDialog` (the
    "Generate with AI" button in `New Character`, item 0's toast-system entry) actually works
    end-to-end against a real running KoboldCpp — gave it a one-line brief, got back a complete,
    well-formed card (description, personality, scenario, first message, tags) in the character's
    intended voice. No code change; this was purely a "make sure the LLM can create characters"
    verification, and it already does, discarded afterward rather than left in the character list.

81. ~~Quick Replies bar~~ — user asked to keep working through the roadmap; picked as the next
    concretely-scoped, koboldcpp-verifiable item off section 14's open list (Generation HUD needs
    live token/sec streaming to be worth building well; World Info sticky/cooldown and the
    trigger/event system both have real, stated design prerequisites). See section 14's checked
    item for the full writeup.

82. ~~Raw vs. processed model output toggle~~ — same live-playthrough pass as #79/#80, picked up
    alongside the pacing fix since both came out of using the Prompt Inspector to verify #79 live.
    See section 15's checked item for the full writeup.

83. ~~Generation HUD~~ — user asked to keep working through the roadmap; next concretely-scoped
    item off section 15 (World Info sticky/cooldown and the trigger/event system both have real,
    stated design prerequisites; the two remaining section 14 items, chat folders/tags and
    Multiple chat-completion backends, are both bigger authoring-surface or architecture pieces).
    Live-verified, and caught a real attribution bug in `/api/extra/perf` along the way — see
    section 15's checked item for the full writeup.

84. ~~`manuallyActivatedIds` dead machinery, removed~~ — user asked to keep working through the
    roadmap; picked as a small, deterministic, fully test-covered cleanup with zero koboldcpp
    dependency. Sizing it first (this item's own two offered options) surfaced that "wire it up"
    was actually the riskier path — the id-collision problem below. See section 9's checked item
    for the full writeup.

85. ~~World Info "at depth" injection~~ — user asked to keep working through the roadmap; picked
    as the concretely-scoped, koboldcpp-independent sub-item of section 14's World Info depth
    bullet (sticky/cooldown and weighted inclusion groups both stay open — the former genuinely
    blocked on the cross-source id problem, the latter smaller but lower-value). See section 14's
    checked sub-item for the full writeup.

86. ~~Seeded Sumire never actually populated her own 10e life-context fields~~ — found live during
    a UI/UX pass through `CharacterEditor`'s tabs: occupation, workplace, home, frequented
    locations, likes, goals, boundaries, and social connections all showed as empty (placeholder
    text only) on the bundled demo character, even though item 53 built the whole feature —
    `characterProfile`, the prompt block that surfaces exactly these fields — well after Sumire was
    originally seeded (item 49) and the seed was never revisited. Meant every fresh install's own
    bundled character failed to demonstrate a real, shipped feature. Filled in `seedContent.ts` with
    values consistent with her existing card (architecture-loving tsundere at Sakura Hill
    University) — deliberately including a boundary ("hates being rushed or pressured into
    anything before she's actually ready") that reinforces this session's own slow-burn-pacing work
    (#79) in her own authored data, not just the global setting. Also applied the same values to
    the already-seeded live character through `CharacterEditor`'s own UI (the seed runner is
    idempotent and won't retroactively update an install that's already past first run) so this
    install's Sumire matches the corrected seed too. Verified live via the Prompt Inspector:
    confirmed every new field (occupation, home, frequented locations, likes, goals, the boundary,
    and the social connection) reaches the actual assembled prompt through the existing
    `characterProfile` block, no new wiring needed since that plumbing already worked — this was
    purely a content gap, not a code bug.

87. ~~Weighted inclusion groups~~ — user asked to keep working through the roadmap; picked as the
    remaining self-contained sub-item of section 14's World Info depth bullet, once koboldcpp went
    unreachable mid-session (confirmed via the Connection tab's own "Not reachable" state, correctly
    surfaced) and ruled out any more live-roleplay-dependent work for the time being — this one
    needed nothing but the existing test suite and a direct API check to verify. Sticky/cooldown is
    now the only sub-item left in that bullet, still genuinely blocked on the cross-source id
    problem. See section 14's checked sub-item for the full writeup.

88. ~~Mobile pass: composer unreachable in VN mode, chat header title crushed~~ — acting as a senior
    UI/UX-focused developer per this session's own framing, with koboldcpp still unreachable ruling
    out more roleplay-dependent work. Reproduced both live at 375×812 rather than guessing from a
    screenshot: the VN-mode composer measured entirely below the viewport (a real, interaction-
    blocking bug — the user could not send a message at all in that state, not just a cramped
    layout), and the ordinary chat header's title block measured 119px wide, crushing the
    character's name to one letter. Both traced to real root causes (a missing `min-h-0` on a flex
    wrapper one level above the already-fixed VN sprite bug; a `shrink-0` icon toolbar whose mobile
    width cap left too little room for the title) rather than papered over, and both verified fixed
    with the same live-measurement rigor as every earlier mobile fix in this file. See section 14's
    "Mobile / responsive layout" item for the full writeup.

89. ~~Rewind~~ — user asked what else could be checked off before koboldcpp comes back; picked as
    a concretely-scoped, fully deterministic section 15 item (no live model needed to build or
    verify) that closes a real, clearly-described gap. See section 15's checked item for the full
    writeup.

90. ~~Discoverable keyboard shortcuts + a shortcuts sheet~~ — same "what else can be checked off"
    session as Rewind (#89); picked as the other concretely-scoped, fully deterministic item on the
    list. Also fixed a genuine, separate gap found while building it: `Modal.tsx` had no `Esc`-to-
    close at all, so this one change reaches every panel built on it. See section 13's checked item
    for the full writeup, including what was deliberately left out of the original wish list and why.

91. ~~App-wide UI/UX polish pass~~ — user asked to "work through the UI/UX, polish it completely,"
    with koboldcpp offline again ruling out roleplay-dependent work. A consistency + refinement
    sweep, not new features, all verified live in the browser (light and dark) plus
    typecheck/build/248 tests green:
    - **Keyboard-focus affordance, app-wide** — a single `:focus-visible` outline rule in
      `globals.css` (accent ring, keyboard-only, text controls opt out to their own inset ring)
      replaces the per-component `focus-visible:` class that *most* buttons in the app never had.
    - **Styled confirm dialog** — new `confirmDialog()` (`useConfirmStore.ts`) + `<ConfirmDialog>`
      (mounted once in `App.tsx` beside `<ToastViewport>`) replaces all 8 `window.confirm()` call
      sites (character/persona/world/book delete, chat delete, message rewind, end-relationship,
      backup restore) with a theme-aware dialog on the app's own surface — Escape / backdrop to
      cancel, danger tone for destructive actions. `Button` became `forwardRef` for its autofocus.
    - **Chat header toolbar declutter** — the ten-icon row (which #71/#88 could only make
      horizontally scroll) is now `ChatToolbar.tsx`: three primary icons (relationship, event,
      objective) plus a "•••" overflow menu carrying the rest *with text labels* — calmer at rest
      and more discoverable than a wall of tooltip-only glyphs. Built once, still rendered in both
      the ordinary header (`tone="chrome"`) and VN mode's glass pill (`tone="glass"`); the
      `overflow-x-auto` clip hack is gone from both (it also would have clipped the new dropdown).
      This is the "what's essential" toolbar redesign #71 explicitly deferred.
    - **Shared view frame** — new `<ViewShell>` (title, description, right-aligned action, one
      column width, one responsive padding) + `<EmptyState>` unify Characters / Worlds / Personas /
      World Info / Gallery / Settings, which had drifted to three heading treatments and two
      container widths (Gallery had a small `text-sm` heading and no centered column at all).
    - **Entrance animations** — `Modal`, `CommandPalette`, and toasts now ease in (`animate-panel-in`
      / `animate-overlay-in` / `animate-toast-in` in `globals.css`, all covered by the existing
      reduced-motion overrides), plus a `backdrop-blur-sm` behind every overlay.
    - **Smaller consistency fixes** — `Toggle` knob recoloured so it stays visible in all four
      theme×state combinations (a white knob vanished against the near-white off-state track in
      light mode); new `<SegmentedControl>` replaces three hand-rolled variants in the Theme editor;
      `focus:ring` added to every remaining bare `<select>`/`<input>` that lacked one; a handful of
      stray `rounded` (16px, between `xl` and `2xl`) corrected to the intended tier.

    Second sweep, same request ("one more check for design, UI/UX, user friendliness, standardisation"):
    - **`Modal` gained a `description` slot** — the one-paragraph "what this panel does" copy that
      every panel hand-rolled as `<p className="mb-3 text-xs text-text-muted">` (13 of them) is now
      a prop, rendered once at `text-sm leading-relaxed` and pinned above the body so it doesn't
      scroll away. `text-xs` for multi-sentence help copy was just hard to read. Converted
      ObjectivePanel, AuthorNotePanel, DateEventPanel (×2), BagPanel, DirectorPanel,
      GenerateCharacterDialog, TemplateGallery, WorldTemplateGallery.
    - **Four hand-rolled modals folded into `<Modal>`** — `TemplateGallery`, `WorldTemplateGallery`,
      and `GenerateCharacterDialog` each had their own `fixed inset-0 … bg-black/40` backdrop + panel
      with no Escape-to-close and no entrance animation; now they get all of it for free.
    - **Native form controls themed globally** — `input[type=checkbox|radio|range]` pick up
      `accent-color: rgb(var(--c-accent))` (+ `cursor: pointer` on checkbox/radio) from one rule in
      `globals.css` instead of a per-instance `accent-*` class on some and browser-blue on others.
    - **Inline `<code>` styled globally** — one `code {}` rule (rounded, sunken bg, mono, 0.85em)
      replaces a hand-rolled `rounded bg-bg-sunken px-1` on one and a bare unstyled `<code>` on another.
    - **`SegmentedControl` reused** for the search-scope toggle (`SearchPanel`), and its `size="sm"`
      variant added for panel-header toggles; `ObjectivePanel`/`CharacterEditor` import failures
      routed through `toastError` instead of the last two remaining local inline-error banners.

92. ~~Theme presets: a "Default" chip + user-created presets~~ — user-reported: after clicking a
    built-in preset (Sakura/Neon Night/High Contrast) there was no obvious way back — the only
    revert was a faint ghost "Reset to defaults" button buried below fifteen colour swatches, while
    presets are applied from a prominent chip row at the top. Two parts:
    - **"Default" is now a chip in that same row**, first, highlighted (`aria-pressed` + accent
      border) whenever the current tokens match a preset exactly — so reverting is as discoverable
      as applying, and the row doubles as a "which preset am I on" indicator. `matchingPresetId()`
      does the comparison; the ghost reset button stays as a secondary path for someone mid-edit.
    - **Presets now apply as a *complete* palette** — new `applyThemePreset(light, dark)` store
      action layers the preset's overrides onto the full defaults, so switching between presets
      can't accumulate stray tokens and a preset that omits a token (all three built-ins omit
      `success`/`warning`/`romance`) no longer leaves the previous palette's clashing value behind.
      `resetTheme()` is its clean inverse.
    - **User-created presets** — `customThemePresets: ThemePreset[]` in `useSettingsStore` (persisted
      to `rp-settings` like every other setting), a "+ Save current colours" control in the Presets
      section snapshots the live light+dark token maps under a name, and each custom chip gets a
      hover-`×` to delete. Colours only — deliberately not the full `chatStyle`/layout/`customCss`
      bundle the separate "Save / share theme" library handles. Verified live end-to-end: tuned a
      colour, saved it as a preset, applied Default then the custom preset (accent tracked both
      ways), deleted it, and confirmed it survives a reload.

93. ~~Prompt overhaul: de-slop every LLM-facing string, user-editable system prompts, rewritten
    seed content~~ — user-driven, koboldcpp offline so verified structurally (typecheck + 255
    tests + build) plus a live pass over every new Settings control:
    - **User-editable system prompt** — the top-of-prompt instruction was a single hardcoded line
      ("write vivid and consistent responses, never break the fourth wall"). Now: a global
      `systemPrompt` + `postHistoryInstructions` in `useSettingsStore`, a new `SystemPromptSection`
      (Settings -> Generation) with a preset picker, and `builder.ts` resolving
      `character.system_prompt` -> global -> built-in default in that order. Post-history steering
      is global and *appends* after any per-character `post_history_instructions`. `builder.ts`
      re-exports the new `systemPrompts.ts`.
    - **Ten built-in system-prompt variations** (`src/lib/prompt/systemPrompts.ts`), each with a
      one-line use case: Balanced, Sparse, Rich prose, Dialogue-driven, Adventure GM, Unfiltered,
      Cozy, Companion chat, Immersive/no-meta, Co-writer. Every one carries the same DNA (write only
      {{char}}, take the voice from the card's own description and example dialogue, avoid the tells
      of AI prose) with a different feel. `promptPresets` in the store lets a user save their own
      {system + post-history} pairs on top.
    - **Ten sampler presets** (`builtinPresets.ts` went from 4 unlabelled buttons to 10 with use
      lines): Balanced, Precise, Creative, Wild, Smooth, Anti-repetition (DRY), Long-form, Snappy,
      Mirostat, Small model. The Generation section's picker is now a `<select>` + description +
      "which preset am I on" detection; `DEFAULT_SAMPLER` was aligned to "Balanced" so a fresh
      install shows a named preset instead of "Custom".
    - **No em dashes** in any string the model sees — swept `builder.ts`, `choices.ts`,
      `relationshipAssist.ts` (incl. the example recap), `objectiveAssist.ts`, `aiAssist.ts`,
      `sceneTag.ts`, `summarize.ts`, `useChatSession.ts`'s style/relationship/gift-taste lines, and
      `GenerateCharacterDialog`'s card-writing instruction (which also gained an explicit
      anti-slop paragraph). The default system prompt, the slow-burn steering line, and the style
      "suggested starter" all now name em dashes as a thing to avoid.
    - **Rewritten seed content** (`server/seedContent.ts`): Sumire's card, her character lorebook,
      the world description + rules, the world's own lore, and the "Campus Life" example book, all
      stripped of the hidden-depths reveal ("beneath the prickliness she's..."), the rule-of-three,
      and the repeated "wouldn't admit it" hedge the seed leaned on. A starter persona ("Kai", thin
      and gender-neutral) is now seeded too, with a one-time back-fill in `seed.ts` for installs
      that predate it.
94. ~~World Info sticky & cooldown~~ — the lorebook-activation feature deferred three times
    (section 3, section 14) because "no stable per-entry key exists across this app's lorebook
    sources". Solved that first: `Lorebook.sourceKey` is stamped by `useChatSession` when it
    assembles the merged book list (`char:<id>` / `world:<id>` / `book:<id>` / `facts`), and
    `${sourceKey}:${entry.id}` is the composite key. Then:
    - `LorebookEntry.sticky` / `.cooldown` (turns), shown as two `NumberField`s in `LorebookEditor`
      for keyword-mode entries only, next to Chance %. ST's own field names, copied straight through
      by `normalizeLorebook` on card import.
    - `activateWorldInfo` takes an optional `{ turn, prevState }` and returns `nextState`; a
      keyword entry stays force-active for `sticky` turns after its keyword stops matching (a fresh
      hit refreshes, a carry-over doesn't compound), and can't re-fire by keyword for `cooldown`
      turns after it deactivates. `always`/`manual` entries ignore both. Old callers that pass no
      runtime get exactly today's behaviour and an `undefined` `nextState`.
    - `Chat.worldInfoState` holds the per-entry bookkeeping, written back on the
      `chatsApi.update(chat.id, ...)` that already fired after each generation round, read on the
      next. Stripped on fork (its turn numbers are absolute and meaningless in an earlier branch).
    - 6 new `activation.test.ts` cases walking multi-turn sequences. 255 tests green.
    ~~**Still open:** `delay`~~ — shipped in #95.
95. ~~World Info `delay`~~ — the last SillyTavern activation field, and the small remaining piece of
    "World Info depth" once #94 put the turn-counter plumbing in place. `LorebookEntry.delay`
    (turns/messages): an entry can't activate at all until the chat has at least that many messages.
    Unlike sticky/cooldown it needs no persisted per-entry state, just the turn counter already
    threaded through for #94 — so it's a single gate near the top of `activateWorldInfo`'s per-entry
    loop, before the mode branch, and therefore applies to every activation mode (`always` /
    keyword / `manual`), matching ST. Like sticky/cooldown it's a no-op for old callers that pass no
    runtime (always threaded in-app). A "Delay" `NumberField` sits in `LorebookEditor`'s options
    grid next to "Unlock warmth" (shown for all modes, not gated to keyword like Sticky/Cooldown).
    `normalizeLorebook` copies it straight through on card import; `wrapCardV2` export and
    `.rppack.json` carry it for free. 4 new `activation.test.ts` cases (delay gate on keyword and
    always entries, no-runtime bypass, no sticky window started while delayed) — 259 tests green.
    Verified live: the field renders for both an always-mode and a keyword-mode entry, a set value
    round-trips through the API and clears back to absent.
96. ~~Mobile ergonomics pass: editors + settings + shared controls~~ — "the rest of mobile/responsive"
    from the roadmap's own next-up list. #71/#77 handled page-level overflow and the core chat
    surface; this is the pass over everything behind that. Systemic changes, mostly in shared
    components so every screen benefits at once:
    - **Tab strips → native `<select>` under `sm`.** `EditorShell` (character + world editors, 7
      tabs) and `SettingsView` (5 tabs) both rendered a horizontal strip that scrolled a couple of
      tabs off-screen with no affordance — the roadmap flagged "scrolls instead of picks" twice.
      Now a full-height native picker on mobile, the visible strip unchanged at `sm`+. Badge counts
      ride along as `Label (12)` in the option text.
    - **Responsive shell padding.** `EditorShell`, `ViewShell`, `Modal`, and `Section` were a flat
      `p-6`/`p-7`/`px-6`; now `p-4 sm:p-*` (and `Modal` `p-5 sm:p-7`, backdrop `p-3 sm:p-4`), giving
      back ~16-24px of content width on a 375px screen. `Modal` also caps at `max-h-[90vh]` on
      mobile (was `85vh`, or uncapped for non-scrollable).
    - **iOS zoom guard + tap targets.** `Field.tsx`'s shared control class, the two search inputs,
      and the chat `Composer` textarea are now `text-base sm:text-sm` — 16px on mobile stops iOS
      Safari auto-zooming the page when a field is focused; desktop keeps the denser 14px. Mobile
      vertical padding bumped `py-2 → py-2.5`.
    - **Stacked field pairs in `CharacterEditor`.** Side-by-side text-input pairs that were unusable
      at ~150px each (social connections name/relation, relationship-starter label/warmth, weather
      loves/hates chip columns, schedule phase/status and activity/location) are now
      `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`.
    - Card grids (`CharacterList`/`WorldsView`/`PersonasView`) tightened to `gap-3 sm:gap-5` and
      `Section` headers `flex-wrap` so a long description + a header control don't crush each other.
    Verified live at 375×812: zero horizontal overflow on every screen checked (Settings all tabs,
    Character editor all tabs, Relationship modal), every visible input measured at 16px on mobile,
    the tab `<select>` switches content correctly; then a full desktop regression pass confirming
    the visible tab strips are back, inputs are 14px again, and every `sm:grid-cols-2` restores the
    original two-column layout. 259 tests green, typecheck + build clean. Left for #97: the mobile
    toolbar icon audit and non-shared-button touch targets.
97. ~~Mobile toolbar curation + touch targets + a `NewChatDialog` bug~~ — the three items #96 left
    open, plus one real bug surfaced while checking them.
    - **`ChatToolbar` `priority: 'primary-desktop'`** — a third tier between "always an icon" and
      "always in the •••​ menu": an icon on `sm`+, a menu row on a phone. Rendered in both places and
      shown/hidden by breakpoint, so there's still no JS media query and the two can't disagree
      about what exists. The date/event and objective actions moved to it, so the mobile chat
      toolbar is Relationship + ••• (plus Back and Log in VN mode) instead of five controls fighting
      the title for width.
    - **VNStage top bar** — the Bond HUD (`absolute left-4`) and the toolbar (`absolute right-4`)
      were independent overlays that overlapped at 375px: measured live, the HUD's right edge was
      ~105px past the toolbar's left edge, painting over the back button and first icons. Now one
      `absolute inset-x-4 top-4 flex justify-between` row — HUD `min-w-0` and truncating, toolbar
      `shrink-0`. Re-measured after: a 12px gap between them, zero page overflow. VN "Log" button is
      icon-only under `sm`.
    - **Shared `Button`** — `py-2.5 sm:py-1.5`: ~40px tall on touch (measured 39px on the
      `NewChatDialog` primary), back to 32px at `sm`+. `IconButton` left alone — it's sized to fit
      the `h-9` glass pill and the message-meta row exactly, and bumping it there risks more than it
      buys.
    - **Bug: `NewChatDialog` was unopenable on a phone with a collapsed chats panel.** It was
      mounted inside `ChatsPanel`'s `hidden w-14 … md:flex` collapsed rail; a returning user with
      `chatsPanelCollapsed` set (a desktop preference) who opened the app on a phone got the dialog
      rendered into a `display:none` subtree — `showNew` flipped true, nothing appeared. Moved to a
      sibling of both panel variants. While there, `NewChatDialog` adopted the shared `Modal`'s
      `scrollable` mode (its own `<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">` wrapper) and
      `text-base sm:text-sm` on its five raw select/input controls.
    Verified live at 375×812: VN HUD/toolbar no longer overlap, the mobile toolbar shows only the
    curated actions with date/objective in the ••• menu, `NewChatDialog` opens and fits; desktop
    regression confirms all five toolbar icons return, the Log label returns, `Button` is 32px
    again. 259 tests green, typecheck + build clean.
98. ~~Manga-style SFX text bursts~~ — a fourth `sfx` segment type from `splitMessageSegments()`,
    tagging a standalone onomatopoeia clause from a curated ~90-word list; every surface that
    already styled `*action*`/`"quote"` gets it for free. Restrained typographic treatment in chat
    (display face, accent colour), a rose glow + `sfx-pop` scale-in in the VN dialogue box only,
    both reduced-motion aware. Never fires inside `"quotes"` (spoken) or on shouted non-sounds
    ("STOP") or inflected verbs ("SLAMS shut"). 9 new parser tests (268 total); verified live in
    chat and VN. Speech-bubble tails (the other half of section 5's original item) stay open.
99. ~~SFX bursts: opt-in + per-character vocabulary~~ — reworked #98 after user feedback that it
    shouldn't be always-on or hardcoded. `splitMessageSegments(text, sfx?)` takes an `SfxConfig`;
    a global toggle + "Extra sound words" field (Settings → Appearance) and a per-character
    `Character.sfxWords` list (Visual novel tab) — a catgirl's "nya", an imouto's tics, styled only
    in her own messages. `sfxConfigFor()` (pure, `src/lib/text/sfx.ts`, tested) does speaker
    resolution for group chats and user messages. Pack-carried, server-validated. 13 new tests
    (281 total). Verified live end-to-end.
100. ~~Background music per world/scene mood~~ (section 6) — `SceneTag.mood` (9 built-ins,
     `src/lib/vn/moods.ts`), `WorldCard.music` (mood-keyed track URLs + `default`),
     `resolveBgmTrack()` with a tagged-mood → location-fallback → default → silence chain that works
     with KoboldCpp off. `BgmPlayer` is a hidden dual-`<audio>` crossfader on a wall-clock timer
     (rAF is paused in a background tab); `GlobalBgm` mounts it once in `App.tsx` above the view
     switch so music survives a trip to Settings. `bgmVolume` slider (Settings → Appearance,
     **default 0** — inert until raised), `useAudioDuckStore` ducks it during Companion TTS. Audio
     uploads stored as files under `data/avatars/worlds/<id>/music/` (`resolveWorldMusicMap`,
     backup/pack-covered); upload slots in the World editor → Scenes tab. 15 new tests (296 total).
     Verified live end-to-end with a generated tone.
101. ~~Speech-bubble tails~~ (section 5, the last open item there) — a small triangle off the top
     of each message bubble pointing toward its avatar, in the `bubbles` chat style only. Pure CSS:
     `.rp-bubble`/`.rp-bubble-char`/`.rp-bubble-user` on the bubble `<div>` in `MessageBubble.tsx`,
     a border-triangle `::before` in `globals.css` coloured from `--c-msg-char`/`--c-msg-user` so it
     always matches the bubble fill (invisible when the theme makes char bubbles blend into the
     page, which is intentional — the bubble is subtle, so is its tail). A `drop-shadow` filter
     gives it the same soft edge as the bubble's `themed-shadow` (a `box-shadow` would track the
     0×0 border box, not the visible pixels). The 7px protrusion sits inside the 12px avatar gap;
     `flat`/`document` styles are untouched. Verified live: computed border colours match each
     bubble, geometry clears the avatar, no `.rp-bubble` nodes in the other two styles.
102. ~~Proactive outreach (section 10f, the headline of section 10)~~ — the two design forks the
     roadmap had flagged repeatedly (how an unprompted message reaches the player; what actually
     drives the timing) resolved with the user first: injected into the existing chat + an unread
     badge, driven by real wall-clock silence rather than the manually-advanced in-fiction clock.
     `evaluateOutreach()`/`generateOutreachMessage()` (new `src/lib/dating/outreach.ts`),
     `useOutreachTick()` (new, called once from `App.tsx`), a new opt-in `Character.outreach`
     field + `CharacterEditor` section, `Chat.lastOutreachCheckedAt`/`hasUnreadOutreach`,
     `StoredMessage.initiatedBy`, a `ChatsPanel` unread badge. Along the way, fixed a real
     `PUT /api/chats/:id` bug (an outreach "no" would still reorder the chat list) and — the bigger
     find — a `<START>`/fake-turn generation bug that turned out to affect the MAIN chat pipeline
     too, not just this new feature (see section 10f's own checked items for the full write-up on
     both). 24 new tests, typecheck + full suite green. Verified live end-to-end with koboldcpp
     running for real: the full outreach loop (eligibility → generation → persistence → badge,
     including correctly NOT badging an already-open chat), and the turn-boundary fix confirmed
     against both a regenerate of a real broken message from the user's own session and a
     completely organic follow-up message they sent mid-verification.

103. ~~Runtime slop scrub + per-character slop steering~~ — #93 de-slopped every *authored* string
     the model sees; this closes the loop on the model's *own output*. New `src/lib/text/slop.ts`
     consolidates three jobs around one shared corpus of AI-prose tells:
     - **`cleanModelOutput`** — a deterministic scrub run once on every completion before it's
       stored (`useChatSession.ts`, right after `extractSceneTag`), so it fixes both what's shown
       and what's fed back into later prompts. Strictly whole-line meta removals that are never
       legitimate character speech: an echoed `Name:` prefix, a leading "Certainly!"-style
       affirmation, an OOC aside, "let me know if…" assistant chatter, a markdown heading, a lone
       unclosed trailing `*`. Never rewrites phrasing inside the fiction. `StoredMessage.rawText`
       keeps the untouched original for the Prompt Inspector toggle. Idempotent, so the
       auto-continue rounds re-running it are harmless.
     - **`truncateAtStrayTurnMarker`** — moved here verbatim from `outreach.ts` (which now
       re-exports it) so the `<START>` / fabricated-turn backstop is one implementation shared by
       the live-chat and proactive-outreach paths instead of two copies. Folded into
       `cleanModelOutput` when `charName`/`personaName` are supplied.
     - **`buildSlopAvoidanceNote`** — steering, not editing. Scans the character's own last 6 turns
       and, only when it finds them, names the *specific* tells and verbatim repeats back to the
       model ("you have already written 'couldn't help but' twice; don't reach for it again"),
       appended to the existing `styleGuidance` string. Returns undefined on clean turns, so it
       costs zero prompt tokens the common case. `findRepeatedPhrases` catches the "keeps saying
       the same thing" habit that no sampler `rep_pen` reaches.
     `SLOP_PATTERNS` deliberately excludes anything merely plain, anything frequency-based, and
     anything a character might plausibly say aloud. 19 new `slop.test.ts` cases, typecheck +
     build clean.
104. ~~Reply length from the card (`src/lib/characters/voice.ts`)~~ — the "responses shouldn't be
     an essay, and should fit the character" half of the same user ask. `sampler.max_length` is one
     number for the whole app, and the system prompt asks for a character's voice "in prose" — so a
     tsundere whose own example turns are nine words got the same 300-token budget as a verbose
     narrator and filled it.
     - **`deriveCardReplyBand`** measures the character's *own* authored turns — the `{{char}}:`
       lines out of `mes_example` (median, so one long scene-setter doesn't drag the card up a
       band), falling back to a discounted `first_mes` — and buckets them brief / moderate /
       detailed.
     - **`resolveReplyLength(character.replyLength, card)`** turns that, or an explicit override,
       into an instruction counted in *sentences* (a unit models actually hold to), appended to the
       existing `styleGuidance` string in `buildCurrentPrompt`. When the band was measured from
       real examples it also points the model back at them ("match the length and rhythm of this
       character's example dialogue").
     - **`replyMaxTokens`** turns the same band into a hard `max_length` ceiling in `runGeneration`,
       so brevity survives a model that ignores the line. Only ever *lowers* the user's Settings
       slider, never raises it. When this band cap (not the user's budget) is what stopped a reply,
       auto-continue is suppressed and `trimToLastSentence` tidies any mid-sentence cutoff.
     - New `Character.replyLength?: 'auto' | 'brief' | 'moderate' | 'detailed'` (server-validated,
       `'auto'`/unset both mean "measure the card"), a "Reply length" `SelectField` in the
       CharacterEditor → Advanced tab with a live hint showing what `auto` currently resolves to,
       carried in `.rppack.json` and backup.
     12 new `voice.test.ts` cases (351 total), typecheck + build clean. Verified live with
     Heimdallr-26B: the editor hint reads "resolves to Brief (~27 words/turn)" for the bundled
     Sumire card; a fresh chat turn came back 43 words / two sentences + one action beat (a normal
     `max_length` would have produced a greeting-length paragraph), clean and ending on a complete
     sentence; server validation accepts a band, rejects garbage, normalizes `'auto'` to unset;
     relationship scoring still fires. **Still open there:** `buildCurrentPrompt`'s `contextBudget`
     still reserves the full `sampler.max_length` for output even when the band cap is smaller —
     harmless (slightly conservative on history), not yet threaded through.
105. ~~Additional model backends alongside KoboldCpp-only `KoboldClient`~~ — shipped as #121,
     closing out section 8 in full: a `ChatBackend` interface both `KoboldClient` and a new
     `OpenAICompatibleClient` implement (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Together, local OpenAI-shim
     servers), a `messages?:` field on `GenerateRequest` that degrades gracefully for every
     call site that doesn't supply one, and a `createChatBackend()` factory that redirects the
     whole app — not just the main chat loop — once Settings is pointed at it. Built to the
     documented API contract plus mocked-`fetch` unit tests first, then genuinely live-verified:
     the user made a free OpenRouter account and handed over a real key, and three real turns
     against `minimax/minimax-m3:free` came back fully in-character with correct streaming,
     relationship scoring, and choice suggestions — see that entry's own write-up for the one
     anomaly worth knowing about (a single empty reply on the very first attempt, not reproduced
     since) and exactly what's still unverified (direct OpenAI/Groq/local-shim endpoints).
106. ~~Provider picker + native chat-completion generation settings~~ — shipped as #122, a direct
     follow-up prompted by the user's own SillyTavern screenshots and the observation "text
     completion and chat completion presets are different." A named-provider picker (eleven vendors'
     documented base URLs, pre-filling Settings → Connection) plus a genuinely separate
     `ChatCompletionSamplerParams` settings object (temperature/top_p/both penalties/reasoning
     effort/verbosity) replacing the KoboldCpp sampler UI whenever that backend is active, in both
     Settings → Generation and the Quick Tuning panel. Building the second piece surfaced a real bug
     in #121's own `systemText`/`conversationText`: the active instruct template's reserved tokens
     (ChatML's `<|im_start|>`, etc.) were leaking into the hosted API's message content verbatim,
     invisible in #121's own test only because it happened to run on the token-free `plain-chat`
     template. Fixed by forcing `plain-chat` for this backend regardless of the user's actual
     instruct-template setting, and re-verified live with ChatML deliberately selected.
107. ~~NovelAI as a third `ChatBackend`~~ — shipped as #123, prompted by the user's SillyTavern
     screenshots showing NovelAI as its own peer of Text/Chat Completion. Reuses the KoboldCpp
     sampler shape directly rather than #122's chat-completion settings, since NovelAI's own sampler
     zoo is close enough. A real assumption caught and corrected mid-build: the initial plan
     (tokenize the prompt with NovelAI's own tokenizer, base64-encode it) came from a lower-level
     Python reference client and turned out wrong — SillyTavern's actual current frontend sends the
     prompt as plain text with `use_string: true`. The tokenizer work wasn't wasted, just
     repurposed: NovelAI's `stop_sequences` genuinely does need token ids, so
     `server/novelaiTokenizer.ts` bundles NovelAI's own published NerdStash tokenizer files (Clio +
     Kayra; Erato deliberately excluded — different tokenizer family) behind a new
     `/api/novelai/tokenize` endpoint. That half is fully verified with real, unmocked tests against
     the actual model files; the generation half is documented-contract-only, since no NovelAI
     subscription was available to check a single real call against.
108. ~~Section 11 in full: A1111, ComfyUI, SwarmUI, and NovelAI image generation~~ — shipped as
     #124, the user's own direct ask to keep going through the four remaining backends overnight.
     One `ImageBackend` interface (`generateImage`/`listModels`) behind a `createImageBackend()`
     factory, matching this section's own long-standing note to do it once rather than four times.
     A1111's contract came from its official wiki with high confidence; ComfyUI needed its own
     official default node-graph workflow substituted with this app's params, since there's no
     simpler endpoint; SwarmUI's session-based API came from its own official docs, though the
     individual field names inside a generation request are the least-confirmed piece of the four;
     NovelAI's image endpoint returns a ZIP archive, handled by reading the local-file-header
     directly and decompressing via the standard `DecompressionStream` API rather than adding a zip
     dependency — genuinely tested with real compressed and uncompressed fixtures, unlike the rest
     of this feature. A new Settings → Images tab configures whichever backend is active, and a
     first minimal `GenerateImageButton` proves the whole thing end to end from the character
     editor's avatar slot — wiring the same button into VN sprites/backgrounds/gallery CGs stays
     open (see the item right after this one). A1111, ComfyUI, and SwarmUI never got a real server
     to test against. NovelAI image did get a real, live check from a free trial account, through
     the actual UI — the request reached NovelAI correctly (auth accepted, body parsed) but a
     trial-account-only reCAPTCHA gate blocked the actual generation, which this client correctly
     didn't attempt to work around. Confirms the client is very likely correct; still needs a paid
     account to fully confirm.
109. ~~Generate directly into a specific slot, with context~~ — shipped as #125, closing out
     section 11 in full. `GenerateImageButton` now wired into every image slot (avatar, per-
     expression sprites, backgrounds, gallery CGs), each seeded with real context instead of a blank
     prompt, plus the headline piece: `GenerateExpressionSetDialog` generates a whole expression set
     from one description in a single pass, sequential calls with live per-slot application, a Stop
     button, and per-item failure collection instead of aborting the batch. A real bug caught before
     shipping: the Stop button checked React state from inside an already-running async closure,
     which can't see a later state update — fixed with a `useRef` instead. Live-verified against the
     real (if trial-restricted) NovelAI account from #124: ran a 2-expression batch, both failed with
     the same known reCAPTCHA error, and the whole orchestration (collection, results summary, UI
     state transitions) handled it exactly as designed.
110. ~~Section 10's remaining partial items: guaranteed expression coverage + AI-assisted authoring
     from a portrait~~ — shipped as #126, the user's own direct ask to complete section 10. One
     shared `resolveExpressionSprite()` fallback resolver replaces the reactive portrait's and VN
     mode's own independent hard-swap-to-avatar logic with a same-family fallback chain first — the
     "guaranteed coverage" this item asked for. `draftCharacterFromPortrait()` covers the
     well-defined two-thirds of "AI-assisted authoring" (drafting a narrative profile from a
     reference image, fitted to the selected world's tone) — "roll a set of dating stats" stays
     open, since that's still a named-but-unspecified concept per this section's own note, and
     guessing at a meaning would be inventing the feature, not completing it.
111. ~~Custom scene locations + a real CG-gallery data-loss bug~~ — shipped as #127, the user's own
     direct follow-up: "make it possible in the World to create more Scene backgrounds, easier to
     add CG gallery." `CustomBackground` closes the gap where world backgrounds (unlike character
     expressions) had no way to add one beyond the fixed 12 defaults — same pattern, a newly-shared
     `slugifyId()` instead of a copy-pasted duplicate. Along the way: a real, unrelated bug where
     saving a CG gallery entry with no image yet (a real trap now that generating one is an async
     operation) silently deleted the whole entry — title, unlock hint, threshold, everything — even
     though the display side already handled a missing image safely. Also shipped in the same
     request: an **intimacy detail setting** (section 2, `intimacyGuidance()`) — a genuine
     user-controlled dial over how explicit intimate scenes get written once earned, separate from
     the existing pacing-only `slowBurnPacing`, defaulting to no instruction at all so nobody's
     existing output changes unprompted.
112. ~~Section 9(c): a one-switch "minimal assists" Settings profile~~ — shipped as #128, picked
     directly off the "whats next" list: two derived-state `Chip` buttons ("All assists on" /
     "Minimal (all off)") in a new "Background AI assists" section atop Settings → Generation,
     batch-setting the four existing assist toggles (`autoSummarize`, `autoDetectTasks`,
     `autoTrackRelationship`, `autoSuggestChoices`) through their existing setters — the same
     derive-don't-duplicate pattern as the sampler-preset and instruct-template pickers elsewhere in
     this app, so there's no fifth persisted "profile" field that could drift out of sync with the
     four real booleans. Live-verified in both directions: clicking "Minimal (all off)" flips all
     four in `localStorage` and swaps the Chip highlight; clicking "All assists on" confirms the
     reverse, and a spot-checked individual toggle (`Auto-track relationship`) mirrors the shared
     value correctly in the on state. Closes out the (c) sub-item in full — (a)'s low-value
     assist-call merge is the only piece of that bullet still open.
113. ~~Section 9(c)'s (a) item: merge task-detection into the relationship judge call~~ — shipped as
     #129, asked as a quick follow-up right after #128 closed out (c). `assessRelationshipMoment`
     (`relationshipAssist.ts`) takes an optional `pendingTasks` list and returns
     `completedTaskIndices` alongside its existing deltas/flags/facts, the same "fold another
     classifier into the call already running" idea item 18 used for scene flags and fact
     extraction. `useChatSession.ts` fires the merged call only when relationship-tracking and
     task-detection are both due the same turn (not suppressed by a live date); a new shared
     `applyCompletedTasks` helper writes the results either from that merged path or from
     `detectAndMarkTasks`'s original standalone one, so the two paths persist identically. An empty
     or missing objective naturally degrades the merged call to a plain relationship check — no
     wasted prompt tokens, no spurious completions. 5 new mocked tests cover the prompt only
     mentioning tasks when asked, valid/out-of-range/malformed index filtering, and a
     model-hallucinated index being ignored when tasks were never asked for. Closes out section 9's
     assist-orchestration bullet in full.

That closes out SillyTavern's full World Info activation engine, plus the last "reasonable next batch," plus sections 10a, 10c, and 10d in full and a first
slice each of 10b and 10f taken directly afterward since 10's own suggested phase order names them
as the foundation everything else in that section reads from. What's left, still deliberately
smaller than the rest of section 10:
1. ~~Vision-based expression detection (section 8)~~ — shipped as #105: `shortlistExpressions` +
   `detectExpressionFromSprites` + `classifyAttachedImageScene` (`src/lib/vn/sceneVision.ts`), an
   opt-in post-reply assist that looks at the character's real sprites (and any attached photo) to
   correct the model's blind `<<scene:>>` tag. Verified live with Heimdallr-26B + mmproj.
2. ~~A proper `Scene` entity (location, objective/atmosphere) and turn-policy options beyond fully
   manual (round-robin, an AI "director," @mention)~~ — shipped as #120 (see section 4's own
   checked items for the full write-up), picked up once item 3 below gave manual group chats an
   actual reason to see real use, exactly the condition this item's own deferral note was waiting
   on. Objective-setting deliberately stayed on the existing `Objective` system rather than being
   duplicated into `Scene`.
3. ~~Multi-character relationship tracking~~ — shipped as #118 (see 10c's own checked items for
   the full write-up): a non-primary participant now has their own tracked affection/stats/gifts/
   gallery, resolved through a new `RelationshipTrack`/`participantRelationships` pair that leaves
   every existing single-character chat's data untouched.
4. ~~The rest of proactive outreach (section 10f)~~ — shipped as #102 (see section 10f's own
   checked items for the full write-up), including the harder, cross-cutting half of context
   budget tiers left deliberately unattempted for now (still genuinely open, just no longer
   blocking this item).
5. ~~Intent chips, live rapport indicator, hidden agendas + walkouts, hangouts~~ — shipped as
   #108/#110/#112/#113. ~~What's left of 10b: breaking the ice + a reactive portrait in the default
   (non-VN) layout~~ — shipped as #117: starting a date/hangout now generates the character's
   opening line immediately (through the same `runGeneration` every reply already uses, not a
   parallel system) instead of leaving an empty composer, and a small floating portrait reacts to
   scene tags in the default layout the way VN mode's sprite already did. This closes out 10b as
   originally scoped — what's genuinely still open is the *bigger* idea a "separate streamed scene"
   would have implied: the `Scene` entity itself (item 2 below), which #117 deliberately built
   around rather than pre-empting.

This list is incremental polish on the app as it exists today. Section 10 (living-world dating
sim) and section 11 (image-generation backends) are a separate, much larger track — see section
10's own "Suggested phase order" for how to sequence that instead of folding it into this list.
Section 12 is further out still — deliberately unscheduled ideas to revisit once section 10's core
exists, not a queue to work through now.

Sections 13 (onboarding/first-run) and 14 (competitive parity) were added after a full
codebase + competitor review. They're not part of section 10's arc — they're about the app being
usable and familiar to someone who didn't build it. Progress so far (all verified live with
KoboldCpp off): ~~Author's Note~~ (#55), ~~global-lorebook binding UI~~ (#56), ~~authoring-UI
rebuild~~ (#57, which also part-closed section 13's "actionable empty states" and "inline help"),
~~on-disk persistence audit~~ (#58), ~~regex scripts~~ (#59), ~~per-turn assist "thinking"
indicator~~ (#60), ~~read CCv3 character cards~~ (#61), ~~first-run Welcome screen + actionable
empty states~~ (#62), ~~persona nudge~~ (#63), ~~instruct-template manager~~ (#64, parts (a)/(b)
only — (c) shipped later, in #77), ~~world templates~~ (#65, pulled forward from 10e), ~~UI SFX +
`reducedAudio`~~ (#66), ~~gate relationship-tracking/choice-suggestion assists per-chat~~ (#70,
world templates' real remaining half), ~~mobile/responsive layout, first slice~~ (#71 — every
other view/editor screen individually, and a real "what's essential" mobile toolbar redesign, stay
open), ~~10f's koboldcpp-independent groundwork~~ (#72 — memory capping and a first slice of
context-budget tiers; the actual world-tick/outreach mechanism and the harder budget-tier
unification stay open), ~~high-contrast theme preset~~ (#73), ~~command palette~~ (#74),
~~director/debug view~~ (#75), ~~`visualNovelMode` per-chat/per-world gating~~ (#76, closing out
world templates in full), ~~mobile/responsive re-audit (no new bugs) + instruct-template manager
part (c)~~ (#77, closing out the prompt/context template manager in full), ~~World Info `delay`~~
(#95, SillyTavern's full activation engine now covered), ~~mobile ergonomics pass over editors +
settings + shared controls~~ (#96), ~~mobile toolbar curation + touch targets + a `NewChatDialog`
collapsed-panel bug~~ (#97), ~~manga-style SFX text bursts~~ (#98), ~~SFX opt-in + per-character
vocabulary~~ (#99), ~~background music per world/scene mood~~ (#100), ~~speech-bubble tails~~ (#101,
closing out section 5 entirely).

The incremental-polish backlog (sections 1–9, mobile, section 5's aesthetic pass) is now empty.
~~Proactive outreach itself~~ (#102, closing out section 10f's headline feature — see that
section's own checked items for the full write-up, including a real turn-boundary bug the live
verification pass caught and fixed in the main chat pipeline too, not just this new feature) is
now shipped, and so is ~~10b's breaking-the-ice opener + reactive portrait~~ (#117), closing out
10b as originally scoped. ~~Multi-character relationship tracking~~ (#118) is shipped too — a
non-primary participant is a tracked relationship now, not a scene NPC — and once that gave manual
group chats a real reason to see more use, ~~the `Scene` entity + turn policies beyond manual~~
(#120, section 4) followed in the same session. ~~Additional model backends~~ (#121) closes out
section 8 in full — an `OpenAICompatibleClient` alongside `KoboldClient` behind one `ChatBackend`
interface, redirecting the whole app (not just the main chat loop) once Settings points at it;
built and mock-tested to the documented API contract first, then genuinely live-verified once the
user made a free OpenRouter account for exactly that purpose — three real turns against
`minimax/minimax-m3:free` came back in-character with working streaming, relationship scoring, and
choice suggestions. ~~A provider picker and native chat-completion generation settings~~ (#122)
followed immediately as a direct SillyTavern-inspired follow-up, and caught a real bug along the
way: the active instruct template's reserved tokens (ChatML's `<|im_start|>`, etc.) were leaking
verbatim into the hosted API's message content, invisible in #121's own test only because it
happened to run on the token-free `plain-chat` template — now forced for this backend regardless of
the user's actual instruct-template setting, re-verified live with ChatML deliberately selected.
~~NovelAI as a third `ChatBackend`~~ (#123) followed the same session, off the user's own
SillyTavern screenshots showing it as a peer of Text/Chat Completion rather than a variant of
either. A real assumption got corrected mid-build here too: cross-checking a lower-level Python
reference client's "tokenize the prompt yourself" approach against SillyTavern's actual current
frontend source (at the user's own suggestion) revealed NovelAI's real, working path is plain-text
`input` with `use_string: true` — the tokenizer work already built wasn't wasted, just repurposed
for the one thing that genuinely does need it (`stop_sequences`, as token ids). ~~Section 11 in
full~~ (#124) followed directly after, at the user's own request to keep going through A1111,
ComfyUI, SwarmUI, and NovelAI image generation overnight — one `ImageBackend` interface, all four
implemented against each project's own official docs, a new Settings → Images tab, and a first
minimal generation UI in the character editor's avatar slot proving the wiring works end to end.
A real NovelAI trial account (the user's own) then gave #124's image client its first live check —
blocked by a trial-only reCAPTCHA gate rather than a bug, confirming the request pipeline itself is
sound. ~~Generate directly into a specific slot, with context~~ (#125) closed out section 11 in
full straight after: every image slot (avatar, sprites, backgrounds, gallery CGs) now seeds a
real, context-aware prompt instead of a blank one, and `GenerateExpressionSetDialog` generates a
whole expression set in one sequential pass — live-verified against that same NovelAI account,
which confirmed the entire batch-orchestration path (collection, results, Stop) works correctly
even though every call still failed on the same trial restriction. Section 8's/11's backends still
haven't produced a single successful real generation this session — every one remains a
documented-contract implementation waiting on an account that isn't trial-limited. ~~Section 10's
remaining partial items~~ (#126) followed the user's own direct request to complete that section:
`resolveExpressionSprite()` gives the reactive portrait and VN mode a shared same-family fallback
chain instead of each independently hard-swapping to the avatar, and `draftCharacterFromPortrait()`
covers the well-defined two-thirds of "AI-assisted authoring" (the undefined "dating stats" third
stays open rather than guessed at). ~~Custom scene locations + a CG-gallery data-loss fix + an
intimacy detail setting~~ (#127) shipped from the same AFK-handoff message, alongside a real,
unrelated bug caught along the way: saving a gallery CG with no image yet used to silently delete
the whole entry. What's left in section 10 now is just section 12's living-world core, plus the
two items sections 2/10 both still flag as genuinely unspecified ("dating stats") or explicitly
deferred pending live-verification ability this session still doesn't have (the context-budget
tier system) — see section 10's own "Suggested phase order" for how to sequence the former.
~~Section 9(c)'s one-switch "minimal assists" profile~~ (#128) followed right after, picked
directly off this same list: two derived-state Chip buttons batch-set the four existing assist
toggles at once, leaving only that bullet's low-value (a) assist-call merge open. ~~That (a) merge~~
(#129) followed immediately as a quick direct ask: task-detection now rides inside the relationship
judge call when both are due the same turn, instead of its own separately-queued request — closing
out section 9's assist-orchestration bullet in full.

Section 15 (added from a user-supplied AI Dungeon competitive analysis) is a separate set of ideas,
not yet folded into this priority order. The high-contrast theme preset (#73) and raw-vs-processed
output in the Prompt Inspector (#82) have both shipped. The user-authored scripting idea is
the standout but is deliberately scoped in stages precisely so it doesn't get picked up as a single
large unplanned effort — see that item's own "smallest first" breakdown before starting on it.

A separate playthrough QA pass (tracked in `PLAYTHROUGH_REPORT.md`, not here) shipped 5 bug fixes
in the same session: the connection-status dot now checks whichever backend is actually selected,
plus a new Settings → Connection "test connection" for hosted providers (OpenRouter's real
auth-validating `/key` endpoint, not its public, always-200 `/models`); a verbatim-echo guard
(`isVerbatimEcho`) stops a weak model's parroted reply from being saved as real dialogue, which
also surfaced and fixed a root-cause scene-tag bug (`extractSceneTag` only ever found the *last*
of two `<<scene:...>>` tags, letting a mid-reply one survive into the generic HTML-tag stripper and
come out as literal `"<>"`); and `endRelationship` now recomputes `relationshipStage` on breakup
instead of leaving it stale, matching every other relationship-write path. Off the back of that QA
pass, and a long unprompted "Character Mind" brainstorm, the user asked for a prioritized 4-item
roleplay-experience push, explicitly deferring image generation: ~~scenes staying static~~ (#130),
~~NSFW unlockables~~ (#131), and ~~a `married` commitment tier~~ (#132) each shipped in turn, each
live-verified against the user's real OpenRouter backend rather than only unit-tested. ~~"Character
Mind," scoped to mood + a private intention~~ (#133) closed out the list — deliberately a first
slice of the much larger brainstorm rather than an attempt at all of it at once, with the
still-open remainder (needs/desires/goals/fears/beliefs/secrets/plans/social graph/rumors) noted
above rather than guessed at. The user's own direct "complete the mind guidance" follow-up
(#134) added the brainstorm's specific 8-category needs list as a third dimension on the same
judge call, and gave mood/need their first real UI surface — while confirming, before adding
anything, that goals/boundaries/social connections were already reaching every turn all along via
the existing `buildCharacterProfileNote`, not a gap that needed closing. The user's next ask, "the
relationship tab really needs an overhaul," then broadened mid-request into a genuine planning
exercise (`EnterPlanMode`, approved before touching code) — ~~a 4-tab panel redesign plus
per-world intimacy-catalog customization~~ (#135) shipped both, alongside confirming the user's
"build a Rance X/STEINS;GATE-style world" question was already fully answerable with existing
lorebook/character-authoring tools rather than new engineering. The user's own direct follow-up —
noticing that "unlocked" never actually meant "usable" — led straight into another planned pass:
~~clickable intimacy actions, a real toy economy, and a first-time-together milestone~~ (#136),
live-verified against the real backend down to a genuine mid-test 429 handled cleanly.

The user then floated a much larger "an LLM automatically creates complete character, persona,
lorebooks, world cards, and more from a short preference brief" idea and asked to start with
character creation. ~~The character slice~~ (#137, see section 10's "AI-assisted authoring" area
for the full write-up): `generateFullCharacter.ts` is a staged orchestrator that drafts the card,
then feeds it forward into profile / bonds / outfits / per-character-lorebook calls — one parseable
call per artifact rather than one blob a local model breaks halfway through — with soft-failure on
every stage past the card, a live per-stage checklist, and a Stop button. It also grew a rewritten
card prompt (`*action*`/`"speech"` markup in `first_mes`, `<START>` in `mes_example`, sharpened
anti-slop style), the same treatment for the per-field "Regenerate" button (grounded rewrite +
slop-naming + an optional steer popover), and the global Writing-style setting now applies to all AI
authoring, not just chat. World/lorebook/persona orchestration and portrait-through-every-stage stay
explicitly open.

Off the same session: ~~the API origin check no longer 403s when the client runs on a port other
than 5173~~ (`server/originCheck.ts` — any loopback origin passes, the cross-site guard's real job
is unchanged); ~~a VN-mode empty-state affordance~~ (a dashed card in `VNStage` naming the specific
missing art — sprites vs world-binding vs backgrounds — per-character dismissible, plus a
Visual-novel-tab note in the character editor when no world is bound); and ~~a fix for "Suggest what
you'd say next" writing the character's turn instead of the player's~~ — `impersonateAsUser` swapped
only the trailing generation cue while the system prompt ("write only {{char}}, never {{user}}") and
every character-behaviour steer below it stayed, so the model wrote {{char}} (or third-person
narration about them). Now `builder.ts` swaps in a dedicated `IMPERSONATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and drops
the card's post-history note and scene tag; `useChatSession` withholds the objective, the
relationship nudge, and the character-behaviour half of `styleGuidance`, leaving only the writing
context and plain prose rules that apply to the player's line too. A `[Write only {{user}}'s next
message. Stop before {{char}} replies.]` reinforcement sits right before the cue. Live-confirmed by
the user (it now writes a first-person line for the persona), which surfaced a follow-on: the model
echoed the `Kai: ` speaker label into the suggestion, since the gen cue already ends with it — fixed
by routing the impersonate result through the same `cleanModelOutput` the character path uses, with
the persona name as `charName` (strips the leading label) and the character name as `personaName`
(cuts a run-on into {{char}}'s reply). 6 new `builder.test.ts` / `slop.test.ts` cases.
